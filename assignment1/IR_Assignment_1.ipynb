              "'Politicising social divides and failings of the parliamentary system have led to this situation  India’s parliamentary democracy is going through a phase of intense confrontation between the dominant ruling party and a weakened but belligerent Opposition Is this situation a consequence of the firstpastthepost FPTP system where a party with the the highest votes gets the seat even if it doesnt win a majority Suhas Palshikar and E Sridharan address this question in a discussion moderated by Srinivasan Ramani Edited excerpts  Prof Palshikar you had written recently about the emergence of a second dominant party system with the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP becoming the central pole of Indian politics ever since it came to power at the Centre in 2014 Even if the BJP has now lost ground with its vote share reducing in various State elections it did retain its highest average cumulative vote share for election cycles That said what similarities and dissimilarities do you see with the hegemonic period of the Congress of the 1950s and ’60s  Suhas Palshikar The similarity is in the vote share numbers garnered by the dominant party and in its capacity to fragment the Opposition In terms of numbers a dominant party gets a disproportionately larger share in seats in legislatures compared to its vote share The other similarity is in its ability to remain dominant by fragmenting the Opposition and so we see the recent discussions on Opposition unity  The dissimilarities are evident in the roots of the dominance and the journeys towards it The Congress emerged as a dominant party as a result of its contribution to the freedom struggle the roles that Gandhi Jawaharlal Nehru and others played then It converted that legitimacy into electoral dominance The BJP emerged in 2014 as electorally dominant and has since been trying to establish its hegemony That is why I have argued that its hegemony is still in the making while it has become dominant electorally  Dr Sridharan the hegemony enjoyed by the Congress in the 1950s and ’60s gave way to trends in Indian politics such as federalisation and regionalisation So even if we had the FPTP system there was a certain degree of diversification that allowed for newer forces to emerge organically Since 2019 the fact that the BJP has garnered a disproportionate seat share relative to its vote share has revived the critique of the FPTP Your view  E Sridharan The BJP’s dominance in both 2014 and 2019 was based on a plurality of votes 31 and 37 converting into a majority of seats and is similar to the Congress’s dominance from 1952 to 1984 which was also based on vote share pluralities converting to seat majorities sometimes twothirds to threefourths majority The FPTP system tends to magnify the seat share of the party with the largest vote share while parties receiving a lower vote share tend to get a much lower seat share There are exceptions such as the Karnataka Assembly elections of 2008 and the Madhya Pradesh elections of 2018 where the party which got a slightly higher vote share got a lower seat share  The BJP is today not as hegemonic as the Congress of the past Fortytwo of the 303 seats that it won in 2019 were in three States — Maharashtra Punjab and Bihar — and were at least partially due to vote transfer from allies seat shares have not reached twothirds majority and the party’s spread across States is less than the Congress’s in its heyday  Also read  What is Proportional Representation  As for the FPTP system I would like to introduce Duverger’s law to your readers Maurice Duverger a French political scientist argued that the FPTP system tends to bring about a twoparty system at the constituency level In countries like India this translated into the establishment of a twoparty system at the State level which happened between 1967 and 1989 Post1990 this produced three kinds of bipolarity Congress versus BJP in a number of States Congress versus the Left in three States and Congress versus regional parties in other States This was an outcome of Duverger’s law operating at the State level  At the national level 2014 marked the end of a 25year period of a coalitionminority government And post2014 there was the emergence of a second dominant party system I don’t think that FPTP necessarily produces polarisation If you look at the proportional representation PR system in Europe and elsewhere where seats are allocated roughly in accordance with the vote share that also produces distinct polarisations Look at the 1978 Sri Lankan Constitution which instituted the PR system Since then there has been ethnic polarisation despite the small parties getting seat shares higher than what they would have received in a FPTP system Similarly in Israel which also enjoys a thoroughgoing PR system there is severe polarisation in ethnic religious and political terms  Also Read Conference on democracy stresses on political reforms  The FPTP system can’t be blamed for polarisation Polarisation is linked to the politicisation of certain social cleavages These cleavages are sometimes dormant in society and can become active or can be activated through mobilisations When certain social cleavages are activated that is when they get magnified by the electoral system  Prof Palshikar today there is little dialogue between the ruling party and the Opposition What explains this stasis  Suhas Palshikar I agree with Dr Sridharan that it is not FPTP that is creating polarisation One of the general reasons for the adversarial relations between the ruling party and the Opposition is the failure in institutionalising the parliamentary system which presupposes a certain negotiation a spirit of give and take and continuous deliberation between the ruling party and the Opposition  We have failed in generating an institutional pattern for this tendency I would locate the beginning of this as the time around the Emergency period when the spirit of dialogue dissipated Since then the dialogue process has been up and down If you come to the current moment I think it is the distrust between the ruling party and the Opposition that has produced this stasis The problem is not about the institutional mechanisms that we adopt it is in the processes that we implement those mechanisms Those processrelated issues can be located in social and other cleavages and how they play out in competitive politics It is the extreme competitive nature of our polity and the frustrations that come with the presence of a dominant party in the system besides the arrogance that stems from electoral dominance that leads to an inability to engage with the Opposition  Also Read Single party dominance democracy imperilled  E Sridharan The confrontational situation in Parliament and other legislatures has heightened in the last couple of years This is due to the sharpening of the ideological level in politics which reflects the cleavages in the society and to the suspicion that the fundamentals of the system are being sought to be changed  The ruling BJP is not a similar hegemonic force as the Congress in the sense that it had in its manifesto issues such as the Citizenship Amendment Bill and the abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir In a way the BJP has an agenda that is beyond the constitutional consensus that guides the policies of most political parties in India Is this a reason for the current state of affairs too  Suhas Palshikar Just to supplement what Prof Sridharan said we witness today a new phase that is marked by a confrontation that is not merely one of political contestation in the ordinary sense of the term Here is a party that wants to change the entire system fundamentally and other parties are still not sure how to respond to that They instinctively oppose it but at the same time they understand that the difference is in the approach of the dominant party that they have to adaptadjust to that stance so that they garner enough votes in the next election This confusion among the nonBJP parties produces not just distrust but lack of clarity on what ideological positions they must take during the ideological onslaught or the offensive of the BJP The BJP has now changed the terms of how the political contestation will be held ideologically and the inability of the nonBJP parties to appreciate and respond to this and to produce an alternative narrative has led to a frustration that is reflected in their various responses to the BJP  E Sridharan There is a perception that the ruling party is pushing against the constitutional consensus which is fairly strong in our system There are about three and a half layers of protection to the basic structure of our Constitution The government needs a twothirds majority in both Houses subject to the presence of at least 50 of the House in attendance The government has a clear but not a twothirds majority in the Lok Sabha It doesn’t have a majority in the Rajya Sabha In order to make constitutional amendments it must get the support of smaller parties which it has been able to get so far  Then it has to go through judicial review — the courts have so far not pronounced on some of the controversial issues that have come up in the last few years  Finally for some articles on CentreState relations it has to pass them through half the State Assemblies  There are ideological shifts going on and new social cleavages that have been activated that have changed the political landscape  Can it be said that federal issues are emerging as the area of contestation with the BJP on the one side and regional parties on the other  Suhas Palshikar In principle the flashpoint in the next five years or so could be the federal relations between the Centre and the States on fiscal or other administrative and political matters The various State parties are still not sufficiently aware of this possibility and therefore they are busy buying peace with the ruling party at the Centre rather than confronting it I don’t see any direct flashpoint emerging politically between the State parties and the BJP immediately though  Also Read BJP seems to have pervaded every nook and corner Ashwani Kumar  Also the ability of the BJP or any Central government in the last three decades to directly transfer resources to local bodies in the States bypassing the State government besides controlling the administrations of the States has weakened the State parties’ ability to take on the Central government Objectively they are not in a position to do so and subjectively they are not sure how to pitch the fight Therefore we have a fascinating period where there is all the making of a federal flashpoint but at the same time the actual flashpoints may be somewhere else in reality  Do you see a mixture of postures — negotiation confrontation and adjustment by various regional parties visàvis the Centre The Biju Janata Dal BJD YSR Congress Party YSRCP Telangana Rashtra Samithi TRS using one ploy the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam DMK and the Trinamool Congress TMC using another and so on  Suhas Palshikar I would use the word ‘acquiescence’ to describe how the BJD YSRCP and the TRS’s relations are with the Centre  To bring the discussion back to the electoral system is a FPTP system with a preference rule system to go along with it a better form of voting than the FPTP system  E Sridharan The Australian electoral system is fairly similar to what you talk about where the first choice party with the plurality vote share will receive secondthird choices of the voter in a process of elimination from the bottom till it reaches the 50 threshold to be declared the winner I think such an alternative system should be assessed in terms of the ease of its use for the voters It would not be easy to operate in India Second as regards the provision that a party must get 50 of the votes through preference voting this would actually make it easier for the leading candidate to bridge the gap between say 40 to 50 as compared to someone else who gets 25 and could possibly contribute to the same kind of magnified majoritarianism that FPTP does in its own institutional way So it may not be that different  Suhas Palshikar To put an extra burden on the voter in the act of voting is unfair and that is why this is not to my liking Second the 50 mark as Prof Sridharan pointed out is artificially achieved  We need to go back to the drawing board on what is the real issue with FPTP which is the disproportionate number of seats accrued by a party despite a lower vote share However if the political system is adequately competitive that aspect of the FPTP system gets politically neutralised and parties tend to get a share of seats which is roughly commensurate to their vote share also  The other issue with the FPTP is that the threshold is so high that newer parties cannot enter the fray Therefore I suggest that rather than the alternative you are talking about one can talk about a system that will supplement FPTP — let’s say have 10 of the seats in the legislature which are included based on the parties’ vote shares This will ensure an entry point for smaller newer parties and keep the political system more competitive  The larger point is if we artificially try to make the political system fairer the natural competitiveness gets distorted and that is why I would generally prefer FPTP both on the grounds of voters’ convenience and a natural competitiveness being allowed in the system  E Sridharan I think there is sufficient diversity at the societal level There is the theory that in a socially diverse country the party system will be diverse — it will not be limited to a twoparty system India seems to support the effective production of multiple parties at the national level even if the FPTP system limits the competition to a bipolar system in the States because these are a multiplicity of bipolarities for example BJPCongress BJPregional party etc and not the same bipolarity  E Sridharan is Academic Director and Chief

              "'The rise of populism is “testimony to the failure of mainstream politics” and politicians need to understand the “pain” of voters Ed Miliband has said  The shadow business secretary said it was important to give answers to the “grievances” in people’s lives while also challenging populism when it is “wrong”  Speaking at the Edinburgh international book festival the former Labour leader said Boris Johnson’s attempt to have a “political culture war” left him on the “wrong side of the argument” over England football players taking the knee  Miliband told a virtual event on Saturday that “the rise of populism is also testimony to the failure of mainstream politics” adding that it needed to address the “deep discontent” that some people feel  “I always think about this advert Donald Trump did two days before the 2016 election which was all about ‘you’ve lost your jobs the global elite have failed you’ and so on” he said  “Some part of what he was saying was right and unless you answer that deep discontent I think explaining better why mainstream politics is really quite good is never going to get you anywhere”  Miliband added “Somebody once said I think ‘Don’t love Trump but love Trump voters’ … I think understanding people’s pain is really important in this The soil in which populism grows this nasty populism grows is discontent and therefore you’ve got to understand people’s pain I think you do also have to sort of call them out”  He said he was “struck” by what happened earlier this year over Johnson “refusing to condemn” those who booed England players taking the knee  Miliband claimed the England manager Gareth Southgate had indirectly “shamed” the prime minister with his comments explaining what the players were protesting about and why it was a “patriotic thing to do”  He added “I think that episode is really interesting for the way in which Johnson and the kind of attempt to have a political cultural war by him really ended up on the wrong side of the argument”  Summarising his own argument Miliband said “One understand the pain that gives populism the ability to grow and succeed And secondly you’ve got to call it out and you’ve got to be strong”  He added “When it’s wrong you’ve got to call it out”'"

Telangana Rashtra Samithi TRS in New Delhi next week  The development is not without significance and it comes at a time when Rao has just launched the Dalit Bandhu scheme which he hopes will become a torchbearer for empowerment of Dalits across the country  Looking to turn the event into a show of strength he will be leading a team of over 100 leaders to the capital All MPs of TRS state ministers state legislators and members of the party executive will attend the ceremony on September 2  The foundation stone laying ceremony has led to speculations in political circles that KCR as the TRS supremo is popularly known will formally announce his entry into the  KCRs ambition to play a key role in the national is wellknown He wants to cobble up a front with likeminded parties as an alternative to both the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP and the Congress which according to him proved to be utter flops in governing the country  Though there are still more than twoandahalf years to go for the Lok Sabha elections political analysts say may use the event to renew his efforts to forge an alternative front  Political observers say will highlight the rapid strides Telangana has made in various sectors during the last seven years He claims that the countrys youngest state has emerged as a role model for all the states in a short span of time  The development also comes at a time when has launched what he calls a revolutionary scheme for social and economic empowerment of Dalits  The regional satrap is projecting Dalit Bandhu as a model scheme and is confident that it will become a torchbearer for the upliftment of Dalits across the country  Under the scheme launched on pilot basis in the Huzurabad Assembly constituency in Karimnagar district every Dalit family will get Rs 10 lakh as grant and they will be free to choose their profession selfemployment or businesses for utilising the funds  KCR has already announced that he is ready to spend Rs 175 lakh crore on the scheme to cover all 17 lakh Dalit families in the state He believes that the scheme will be a big game changer for Dalits and eliminate social discrimination against them  The TRS chief who has been talking of providing an alternative to the BJP and the Congress for the last 34 years will put forth the successful Telangana model before the country and promise to replicate the same at the national level  TRS leaders say KCR will try to highlight how his government has delivered on various fronts in a short span of time to transform an arid region into a lush green and prosperous state  With a growth rate and per capita income higher than the national average and continuing impressive growth even during the Covid19 pandemic Telangana is already claiming to be a role model for other states  The TRS founder plans to unveil his agenda for national politics with a new economic model which will focus on farmers Analysts say that KCR will showcase at the national level his success in transforming agriculture with Rythu Bandhu an investment support scheme for farmers which is emulated by the Centre and many states  KCR has been slamming both the Congress and the BJP as storytellers who failed to give direction to the country and guide it on the right path He has been targeting them for failing to create wealth while claiming that his government succeeded in not only creating the wealth but is also distributing the same among the poor and underprivileged sections of the society  It was in 2018 that KCR had floated the idea of a front of likeminded parties as an alternative to both the BJP and the Congress  He had intensified the efforts after retaining power in Telangana in the December 2018 elections  After the massive victory in Assembly elections KCR had appointed his son KT Rama Rao as the working president of the TRS so that he can focus on national politics  He flew from one state to the other to meet leaders of various regional parties He called on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin  He also discussed the idea with HD Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal Secular in Karnataka Hemanth Soren of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Jharkhand Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of the YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh  KCR was even seen as the potential prime ministerial candidate by his party in the event of regional parties emerging as a major bloc in the Lok Sabha  With the BJP retaining power at the Centre with a massive majority KCR had dumped the idea of a front and confined himself to the state  Last year there were reports that KCR was planning to float a national party He however clarified that there was no such proposal for now  He however did not rule out such a proposal He told a party meeting that a decision would be taken at the right time after discussions  KCRs blow hot blow cold stand on the third alternative has come under criticism from various quarters His opponents say he talks of a front only at the time of elections  During the campaign for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation GHMC elections in November last year he had stated that the country definitely needs a new experiment and TRS would be in the forefront to provide the alternative  He had declared that a conclave of likeminded parties will be held in Hyderabad in December  He had also said that Hyderabad would be the epicentre of the movement against the BJP government for its antipeople antifarmer and antilabour policies and the TRS will lead the movement  However KCR adopted complete silence on the proposed front after the GHMC polls  IANS  msarmksk  Only the headline and picture of this report may have been

              "'The impulse to write the great Indian novel has been too tempting to resist for a number of Indian English novelists From Qurratulain Hyder through Shashi Tharoor to Vikram Seth many have written their own great Indian novels works of considerable merit but not the great Indian novel  Such is the diversity of lands people and cultures in India that most novels of this kind remain regional in focus however ambitious they may be in scale Delhi Mumbai KolkataBengal Kerala and western India have usually provided settings and characters in Indian English novels But Uttar Pradesh an area which has wielded considerable political influence in independent India has held out its appeal to a host of Hindi and Urdu writers and poets but has only occasionally appeared in Indian English fiction  One can think of Lucknow in Attia Hosain’s Sunlight on a Broken Column Lucknow and Benaras in Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy Benaras in Pankaj Mishra’s The Romantics and western UP though cursorily in Mirza Waheed’s Tell Her Everything But Uttar Pradesh’s geography and its political significance has largely been absent in Indian English novels  Observing the quotidian  The Politician is unabashedly a north Indian novel more specifically a novel about a specific region in central Uttar Pradesh Written in a realistic mode not trying too hard to embellish the narrative with literary texture it provides a glimpse into the political culture of this region All characters in the novel obviously speak Hindi – and the novel is imbued with a Hindispeaking culture – but such is the quality of Devesh Verma’s expressive prose that The Politician might appear a lesser work if rendered into Hindi losing its novelty and freshness  Every bit a twentyfirst century Indian English novel it neither tries to write back to a centre nor cares for a western reader The novel captures both the energy and the chaos that characterise life in small towns in Uttar Pradesh showing effortlessly both the machinations of power politics and mounds of filth  The narrator in The Politician is certainly a great observer of the ordinary daytoday life in Uttar Pradesh directing the reader’s gaze to the poor children “who wanted to push the jeep” quarrelling among themselves or constantly sniffling “to hold back the snot that would peek through before being drawn back in quickly” a candidate for a job surprising a big official “by his correct use of the conjunction ‘lest’” or the landline phones always developing snags and the telephone officials’ indifference to people’s complaints  In many places the description of filth – of “clogged urine outlet an assortment of faecal mounds of various sizes and colour” – fills up the narrative EM Forster had been reminded of the virtue of reticence in western literature while thinking of the filth and the description of bowel movements in Mulk Raj Anand’s Untouchable It is another matter that HG Wells discovered James Joyce’s “cloacal obsession” in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man while another reviewer found Dublin too ugly in the great modernist’s work  Verma writing in the 21st century does not have to think about reticence All chaos and disorder in mofussil India which is routine and to which people have become accustomed is captured by his expressive prose at these moments Even the description of filth is treated with humour Thus in a choice between an extraordinarily filthy and foulsmelling urinal which displays the picture of a “smiling prime minister with a rosebud in the buttonhole of his white khadi waistcoat” and the boundary wall people make for the boundary wall  Caste and crew  The energy latent in the political culture of Uttar Pradesh is the main subject of The Politician The communal angle of this political culture has interested many novelists but The Politician brings the elephant of caste arithmetic into the world of English novel especially the relationship of caste and politics in the Hindi heartland  Mulk Raj Anand wedded to his social realism brought out the issue of caste in Untouchable Arundhati Roy brought in the caste angle through the forbidden relationship of Ammu Ipe and Velutha in The God of Small Things Caste obviously is an important subject in Dalit literature But novels about a specific backward caste in this case Kurmis of Western UP have been nonexistent in Indian English fiction  The Politician views entire election campaigns for parliamentary and assembly seats from the angle of Kurmi influence in and around Fatehpur and Kanpur This is also seen in the larger national politics of the Congress and the nonCongress parties before the ascendancy of rightwing politics Criticism of Brahminical influence in Indian politics completes this picture  In treating political themes The Politician also sets up a dialogue between different political ideologies living up to the polyphonic character of a novel It dwells on the personalities and ideas of a number of major Indian political figures like Jawaharlal Nehru Indira Gandhi Morarji Desai and Jayaprakash Narayan and minor ones like Raj Narayan Banarsi Das Gupta and Sampoornanand  Ambedkar Periyar and Phule are referred to for their radical political views in the discussions of characters about caste Some other major characters in the novel are based on real political figures Baran Singh appears to have been modelled on former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh and Sansadji on the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna  Characters and narratives  Taking the reader back and forth in time Kartik Verma the narrator who is the head at a new TV news channel is also a minor character in the novel The notes and diaries left for him by his deceased friend Deena give him privileged access into the world of Ram Mohan Deena’s father and the central character in The Politician turning the novel into a kind of third person narrative though sometimes interrupted by his first person narration  But the point of view in the novel is that of Deena a sensitive soul in a ruthless world mediated by Kartik his alternative self who studied with Deena at Jawaharlal Nehru University Deena’s peaceloving nature his devotion to vegetarianism his tender self and his inability to adjust to the cruelty and viciousness in the world are aspects of the latent ethos of the novel contrasting beautifully with the novel’s overt cynicism  The first two sentences of the novel also used on the book jacket immediately pull the reader into the narrative “I was about to leave for work when the telephone rang Deena was dead” Did we hear the echo of the opening sentence of Camus’ Outsider “Mother died today”  Ram Mohan a college teacher of Hindi and a scholar who has written a book of Hindi grammar nurses a political ambition which is further whetted by his political mentors However despite being the main character in the novel Ram Mohan’s character appears very thin for almost two thirds of the novel It is only in the final third that he is fully realised letting readers make their judgment about him  Whatever idealism he might have aroused earlier is completely punctured His authoritarian and patriarchal thinking is outweighed only by his hypocritical morality He evinces no active virtue through the 350andodd pages of the novel The secondary characters appear more interesting Is it because many of them are inspired by real life figures Baran Singh’s ideas beliefs and habits are sharply drawn Dixit ji with his novel morality sticks in the mind Sansadji’s near and distant presence his vacillations and permanent promise to deliver also hold the narrative beautifully  History and fiction  No novel can escape history – however it may try to give history the slip Contrarily novels may faithfully use actual political and historical events and situations but still cannot pass as history as novels do what only they can not the textbooks of history The success of Sunlight on a Broken Column or for that matter Milan Kundera’s and Amitav Ghosh’s novels is largely due to their fine blending of history and the main narrative  The movement from history to narrative and vice versa is seamless in Sunlight and Unbearable Lightness of Being to take just two examples This seamlessness deserts The Politician at some places where the reporting of actual historical events and developments in independent India has an obtrusive presence  Most poetic and novelistic creations defamiliarise the familiar the mundane the everyday The treatment of distant events in history achieves a defamiliarising effect more easily than more recent historical developments unless used as a context for the main narrative Events like the China War Nehru’s politics and Indira Gandhi’s taking over the Congress are too fresh in public memory permanently kept on the boil by an overzealous Indian media and speeches of leaders  But most certainly there are varied interpretive communities of readers in terms of age groups regions nationalities and gender The Politician will achieve a defamiliarising effect for the new generation of readers and an international audience not necessarily based in India The role of relatively marginal political figures like Charan Singh or Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna is almost forgotten today and they may not even be recognised by most readers behind their fictional personas  It is not even required to know the actual people a novelist uses to conceive characters because no novel is a mere copy of real life Real life figures when used as characters undergo a transformation in the hands of a novelist because they must look authentic in the novel They do in The Politician  Readers usually discover new facets of life when reading the fiction of another culture and recognise familiar things when reading works of their own culture But even our own culture may hold elements which may be in danger of being forgotten or which may not have been foregrounded in fiction enough The treatment of many of such elements in particular the chaos and disorder in the everyday life in small towns and the relationship between caste and politics in the Hindi heartland before the grand success of the rightwing make The Politician a welcome addition to the canon of Indian English fiction  Mohammad Asim Siddiqui is

              "'The Kerala model has come under fire after the state started goofing up on Covid Despite a fall elsewhere in God’s Own Country Covid infection levels have refused to subside and the state continues to account for over 69 per cent of daily new cases and 56 per cent of all active cases in the country as on 30 August  This is however not enough to debunk the Kerala model which can loosely be said to be about high literacy and good quality healthcare services These continue to be the state’s strong points as is evident from the fatality rates in Covid With 20000andodd deaths from four million infections compared to 438000 deaths from 327 million cases allIndia Kerala’s fatality rate is less than 40 per cent of the national average of 13 per cent from official reported statistics This can hardly be called a failure of the Kerala educationcumhealthcare model  But the underlying assumptions behind this Kerala model — that this high performance on social indicators is led by high state spending on public goods like education and health — is no longer true As Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya noted in their book India’s Tryst With Destiny the Kerala model is not any more driven by state spending but by private investment and consumption Far from being a communist paradise its growth has been driven by entrepreneurship and private investment and spending in both education and health apart from tourism The state is claiming credit for things it did not do  If one has to talk about any Kerala model that is broken it has to begin here and also in it dramatically shifting demographics Rising economic and political challenges are threatening the Kerala model of growth and social stability like never before  The economics that is falling apart a large part of private spending over the last few decades has been financed by huge remittances from the Gulf region where many Keralites are employed But this boom has gone bust postCovid and the World Bank estimates that of the four million Malayalis working in the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC region 12 million have been repatriated back due to job losses and retrenchments This means remittances are down too  A Business Standard report quoting the World Bank had this to say this May In Kerala “an estimated 12 million migrant workers out of more than four million who worked in the GCC countries and contributed 30 per cent of the states income returned in 2020 after the global pandemic left them jobless Lowskilled workers were the hardest hit”  Monthly remittances to families receiving them “fell on average by 267” That’s a Rs 20000 fall in family monthly incomes for those dependent on Gulf remittances Since it is unlikely that most of these jobs will return postpandemic Kerala’s economic model of high dependency on remittances will prove to be a serious problem  But it is in the political and social spheres that the secular Kerala model appears most broken  Till recently Kerala had a twofront model with one front the United Democratic Front or UDF being a collection of communal organisations claiming to be secular the other front the Left Democratic Front LDF claimed to be secular by definition since the Left supposedly believes in materialism not religion the opium of the people  But underneath this apparent secularism what we actually got was two mildly Hinduphobic fronts one driven by actual minority communalists and the other by a Hindu vote that did not see a future in a front where Muslim and Christian parties called all the shots  But two things have happened over the last decade to undermine this cosy twofront system under which each front got to rule the state by turn In this year’s assembly elections the LDF created history by winning a second consecutive term This has little to do with voter faith in this secular alternative It reflects a failure of the communal UDF to win enough Hindu votes to retain power The Hindu vote is gradually breaking off from this communal front though it is still rudderless and without a party to claim its loyalties  In the assembly elections Bharatiya Janata Party BJP won 113 percent of the vote which was enough to deny victory to the UDF but not big enough to dent the LDF or make it a formal contender for power  This churn in the Hindu vote is far from over and in the coming elections we will see new alliances to defeat the Left  The reason why the Hindu vote is again beginning to waver from its traditional voting patterns is the dramatic shift in Muslim demography over the last decade  According to the 2011 census Muslims accounted for 2656 per cent of Kerala’s population and Christians 1838 per cent This means the Hindu majority 5473 per cent is now under clear threat and Christians with lower birth rates are beginning to fret about the growing Muslim demography The actual Hindu population may be closer to the halfway mark except for the undeclared status of crypto Christians who may have chosen to call themselves Hindu to avoid loss of quota benefits  In 2015 recorded birth rates show that Muslim births had almost caught up with that of Hindus even though Hindus are twice as large in the population Reports of live births in that year showed that of the 516 lakh children born 428 per cent were Hindu and 414 per cent Muslim with Christians at 154 per cent  This suggests that despite there being no appreciable difference in human development parameters or incomes of Muslims their birth rate may be surging with Hindu and Christian families punching far below their population weights This goes against every assumption made in the past that high poverty levels are the reason for high birth rates With Muslims in Kerala this does not seem to be the case  This trend if confirmed in subsequent years will polarise the state in future elections The biggest shift could happen among Hindus and Christians and that fact that both these religious groups talk about love jihad demonstrates that there is concern about demographic decline  The Kerala sociopolitical map is being redrawn with the shift in favour of Muslim demographics and this has been accompanied by the rise of more radical Islamist groups like the and its political arm the Social Democratic Party of India The emergence of this group will push relatively moderate Muslim parties like the Indian Union Muslim League to make more demands from any front that it backs in future  It is not the Kerala educationandhealthcare model that is broken but its economic and sociopolitical model that gave it some degree of political predictability since 1947 that has been stretched to breaking point It is likely to be broken in this decade  The Kerala healthcare model remains intact what is broken is merely the excessive pride in that model thanks to the LDF’s hubris'"

              "'Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao may revive his idea of a federal front and gear up to play a key role in as he is all set to lay the foundation stone for the office of Telangana Rashtra Samithi TRS in New Delhi next week  The development is not without significance and it comes at a time when Rao has just launched the Dalit Bandhu scheme which he hopes will become a torchbearer for empowerment of Dalits across the country  Looking to turn the event into a show of strength he will be leading a team of over 100 leaders to the capital All MPs of TRS state ministers state legislators and members of the party executive will attend the ceremony on September 2  The foundation stone laying ceremony has led to speculations in political circles that KCR as the TRS supremo is popularly known will formally announce his entry into the  KCRs ambition to play a key role in the national is wellknown He wants to cobble up a front with likeminded parties as an alternative to both the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP and the Congress which according to him proved to be utter flops in governing the country  Though there are still more than twoandahalf years to go for the Lok Sabha elections political analysts say may use the event to renew his efforts to forge an alternative front  Political observers say will highlight the rapid strides Telangana has made in various sectors during the last seven years He claims that the countrys youngest state has emerged as a role model for all the states in a short span of time  The development also comes at a time when has launched what he calls a revolutionary scheme for social and economic empowerment of Dalits  The regional satrap is projecting Dalit Bandhu as a model scheme and is confident that it will become a torchbearer for the upliftment of Dalits across the country  Under the scheme launched on pilot basis in the Huzurabad Assembly constituency in Karimnagar district every Dalit family will get Rs 10 lakh as grant and they will be free to choose their profession selfemployment or businesses for utilising the funds  KCR has already announced that he is ready to spend Rs 175 lakh crore on the scheme to cover all 17 lakh Dalit families in the state He believes that the scheme will be a big game changer for Dalits and eliminate social discrimination against them  The TRS chief who has been talking of providing an alternative to the BJP and the Congress for the last 34 years will put forth the successful Telangana model before the country and promise to replicate the same at the national level  TRS leaders say KCR will try to highlight how his government has delivered on various fronts in a short span of time to transform an arid region into a lush green and prosperous state  With a growth rate and per capita income higher than the national average and continuing impressive growth even during the Covid19 pandemic Telangana is already claiming to be a role model for other states  The TRS founder plans to unveil his agenda for national politics with a new economic model which will focus on farmers Analysts say that KCR will showcase at the national level his success in transforming agriculture with Rythu Bandhu an investment support scheme for farmers which is emulated by the Centre and many states  KCR has been slamming both the Congress and the BJP as storytellers who failed to give direction to the country and guide it on the right path He has been targeting them for failing to create wealth while claiming that his government succeeded in not only creating the wealth but is also distributing the same among the poor and underprivileged sections of the society  It was in 2018 that KCR had floated the idea of a front of likeminded parties as an alternative to both the BJP and the Congress  He had intensified the efforts after retaining power in Telangana in the December 2018 elections  After the massive victory in Assembly elections KCR had appointed his son KT Rama Rao as the working president of the TRS so that he can focus on national politics  He flew from one state to the other to meet leaders of various regional parties He called on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin  He also discussed the idea with HD Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal Secular in Karnataka Hemanth Soren of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Jharkhand Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of the YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh  KCR was even seen as the potential prime ministerial candidate by his party in the event of regional parties emerging as a major bloc in the Lok Sabha  With the BJP retaining power at the Centre with a massive majority KCR had dumped the idea of a front and confined himself to the state  Last year there were reports that KCR was planning to float a national party He however clarified that there was no such proposal for now  He however did not rule out such a proposal He told a party meeting that a decision would be taken at the right time after discussions  KCRs blow hot blow cold stand on the third alternative has come under criticism from various quarters His opponents say he talks of a front only at the time of elections  During the campaign for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation GHMC elections in November last year he had stated that the country definitely needs a new experiment and TRS would be in the forefront to provide the alternative  He had declared that a conclave of likeminded parties will be held in Hyderabad in December  He had also said that Hyderabad would be the epicentre of the movement against the BJP government for its antipeople antifarmer and antilabour policies and the TRS will lead the movement  However KCR adopted complete silence on the proposed front after the GHMC polls  IANS  msarmksk  Only the headline and picture of this report may have been

              "'Urban and housing design has intimate connections to health Poor design choices can worsen health with underlying issues of inequality a driving factor Share on Pinterest Where we live and the design of our living spaces have a significant impact on health Andrew ThomasGetty Images Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and of his family” This includes housing food clothing medical care social services and security if events beyond a person’s control affect their livelihood Researchers have shown that adequate housing has intimate links to a person’s physical and mental wellbeing According to the Executive Summary of the World Health Organization’s WHO Housing and Health Guidelines  poorly designed housing can increase the risk of trips falls injury isolation and stress for older people or people with disabilities Further insecure or unaffordable housing can exacerbate stress Housing that is too hot or cold or exacerbates indoor air pollution can cause respiratory and cardiometabolic issues Crowded housing or housing with a poor water supply can increase the spread of infectious diseases Speaking to Medical News Today Robert Huxford Director of the Urban Design Group London said that questions around the relationship between health and urban or housing design have a long history “It’s often forgotten that the links between housing and urban design and health go back hundreds of years such as the 19thcentury public health movement including the Health of Towns Association of the 1840s or the Model Byelaws issued in the 1870s that governed urban development in England for the next 50 years” “They focused on lighting ventilation overcrowding damp and sanitation They specified the minimum width of streets minimum spaces around buildings and that habited rooms should have a window at least onetenth of the floor area Over 100 years on developers are bringing forward proposals for windowless flats” For Huxford the COVID19 pandemic has brought historical concerns around housing and infectious diseases back to the fore “In the 19th century the main causes of death were infectious diseases such as tuberculosis cholera and typhoid” said Huxford “The public health works of the 19th and 20thcentury saw infectious disease brought under control further aided by advances in medical science However the COVID19 pandemic has shown that we remain vulnerable to infectious disease and the prospect of drugresistant diseases is a grave international concern” “It is of the utmost importance that housing and urban design provides resilience to infectious disease risk” Backing up Huxford’s point in an article in the journal PLOS ONE  researchers found an association between the amount of poor quality housing in a United States county and COVID19 incidence and mortality  Cardependent development According to Katja Stille Chair of the Urban Design Group and Director of Tibbalds Planning and Urban Design broader urban design choices can have direct adverse effects on a person’s health Speaking to MNT Stille said “the main urban factors that negatively affect a person’s mental and physical health are air pollution from road traffic as well as noise pollution” “Living in a cardependent development will impact negatively on people’s ability to exercise and encourage a sedentary lifestyle that easily leads to obesity heart disease and diabetes The opportunity to be physically active throughout one’s daytoday life such as active transport — walking and cycling — is important to avoid obesity” Dr Steven Fleming author of Velotopia The Production of Cyclespace in Our Minds and Our Cities also highlights the issue of carcentric urban design Dr Fleming said to MNT that a “house with a garage is designed to send you on your way driving for a day of no exercise whatsoever An apartment block is only slightly better because the day of walking it was designed to set in motion — with its lift or stairs leading onto the street — will have negligible metabolic equivalent of task MET minutes If you already have overweight you’ll be looking for a taxi or bus because walking is painful for people with obesity” The definition of one MET is “the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest” “In my book Velotopia” continued Dr Fleming “I detailed in drawings and architectural jargon apartmentstyle housing that would set you on your way on your bike You would leave your tenth story apartment and rather than waiting for a slow lift just ride past all the other apartments arranged around a sloping typically spiraling corridor or what we call an ‘access gallery’ or sometimes an ‘aerial street’” “That would be the start of a day with far more METminutes than the one you started on foot and that wouldn’t be painful if you have obesity” Robert Huxford also has issues with designs that prioritize motor vehicles “The impact of motor vehicles is significant bringing noise high intensity street lighting air pollution and the risk of injury from collisions into urban areas”  Mental health Housing and urban design issues can also adversely affect mental health Speaking to MNT Dr Layla McCay Director of the Centre for Urban Design and Mental Health said that “homelessness and housing insecurity are a key risk factor for mental health problems” “For those who do have a home the affordability of the home is key as economic concerns have links to mental health problems so too is the quality of the housing including dampness noise pests and overcrowding” “Location of the housing is also important including neighborhood quality and safety access to key facilities including education jobs and healthcare And any aspect of the housing that stigmatizes its residents can also negatively affect residents’ mental health” “Housing that is available safe adequate affordable and comfortable and that offers its residents a degree of privacy while also facilitating multigenerational living where desired can benefit people’s mental health” she continued “Housing has the opportunity to further support people’s mental health by facilitating residents to develop positive relationships with their neighbors and to foster feelings of inclusion and belongingness”  Security and homelessness As Dr McCay highlights the security of housing — whether a person owns their home or cannot keep up with the mortgage whether they have a longterm rental contract or whether they face the possibility of eviction with no notice — can be just as important a factor for a person’s wellbeing as the physical conditions of the home Prof Deborah K Padgett of the Silver School of Social Work in New York University an expert on the intersection of homelessness and mental or substance use disorders spoke with MNT She explained that while insecure housing is a complex topic it has some key root causes “Global housing instability is due to severe poverty and lack of institutional support for ‘public’ or ‘social’ housing that is affordable” “The United Nationsendorsed concept of ‘housing is a right’ is in my opinion the most contested and least attractive of human rights supposedly guaranteed by governments This is in part because demand so overwhelms supply as world population growth soars” “But the last decades since the Reagan administration here in the US have seen heavy privatization of housing development and this naturally excludes the poor In countries like India the millions living in slums are not considered ‘homeless’ but this obscures the deplorable living conditions they endure” “From a personal level daytoday survival is a struggle to procure food clean water sanitary facilities etc — whether living in a slum a shantytown or on a park bench” said Prof Padgett For Prof Padgett a primary factor that affects the relationship between housing and mental health is homelessness However people too often presume that mental health issues cause homelessness when the reality is not straightforward — a point Prof Padgett recently outlined in an article for the journal BJPsych Bulletin Prof Padgett told MNT that “homelessness and mental health have a bidirectional relationship but it’s also complicated While serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia account for a minority of homeless persons these individuals are more likely to be chronically homeless and have needs that create more costs for the system — hospitals jails shelters and so on” “They are also more likely to be visible in public and thus skew public perceptions away from the fact that most homeless people are families with small children youth ‘new’ homeless older Baby Boomers and others” “Sadly the hyperfocus on serious mental illness diverts attention from the trauma caused by being homeless and this remains understudied — in part because it is often trauma compounded by childhood adversity and traumatic events earlier in life”  Inequality For Dr McCay an underlying issue in poor health associated with urban and housing design is wealth inequality “Housing is inextricably linked to mental health and wellbeing but access to housing and the quality of that housing varies according to a wide range of factors particularly wealth” said Dr McCay “Inequalities in people’s access to safe affordable goodquality housing can lead to inequalities in their mental health and wellbeing People’s mental health can also be affected by ‘segregation by design’ for example where people who own their homes are separated by design features from people who live in social housing even within the same building creating stigma and exacerbating inequality” “During the COVID19 pandemic we saw evidence of housingrelated inequalities where some people were able to relax and play in their gardens while others had no outside space some had good quality local parks and others had to travel outside their neighborhood to find safe and pleasant green space” For Prof Peter Bishop a professor of urban design at the Bartlett School of Architecture University College London various forms of social deprivation including poor housing and urban design correlate with worse health outcomes Speaking to MNT Prof Bishop said “There is a clear correlation between physical and mental health and indices of multiple deprivation Public Health England lists childhood experience education stable housing and secure employment as the core contributing factors to health and wellbeing”'"

              "'Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao may revive his idea of a federal front and gear up to play a key role in as he is all set to lay the foundation stone for the office of Telangana Rashtra Samithi TRS in New Delhi next week  The development is not without significance and it comes at a time when Rao has just launched the Dalit Bandhu scheme which he hopes will become a torchbearer for empowerment of Dalits across the country  Looking to turn the event into a show of strength he will be leading a team of over 100 leaders to the capital All MPs of TRS state ministers state legislators and members of the party executive will attend the ceremony on September 2  The foundation stone laying ceremony has led to speculations in political circles that KCR as the TRS supremo is popularly known will formally announce his entry into the  KCRs ambition to play a key role in the national is wellknown He wants to cobble up a front with likeminded parties as an alternative to both the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP and the Congress which according to him proved to be utter flops in governing the country  Though there are still more than twoandahalf years to go for the Lok Sabha elections political analysts say may use the event to renew his efforts to forge an alternative front  Political observers say will highlight the rapid strides Telangana has made in various sectors during the last seven years He claims that the countrys youngest state has emerged as a role model for all the states in a short span of time  The development also comes at a time when has launched what he calls a revolutionary scheme for social and economic empowerment of Dalits  The regional satrap is projecting Dalit Bandhu as a model scheme and is confident that it will become a torchbearer for the upliftment of Dalits across the country  Under the scheme launched on pilot basis in the Huzurabad Assembly constituency in Karimnagar district every Dalit family will get Rs 10 lakh as grant and they will be free to choose their profession selfemployment or businesses for utilising the funds  KCR has already announced that he is ready to spend Rs 175 lakh crore on the scheme to cover all 17 lakh Dalit families in the state He believes that the scheme will be a big game changer for Dalits and eliminate social discrimination against them  The TRS chief who has been talking of providing an alternative to the BJP and the Congress for the last 34 years will put forth the successful Telangana model before the country and promise to replicate the same at the national level  TRS leaders say KCR will try to highlight how his government has delivered on various fronts in a short span of time to transform an arid region into a lush green and prosperous state  With a growth rate and per capita income higher than the national average and continuing impressive growth even during the Covid19 pandemic Telangana is already claiming to be a role model for other states  The TRS founder plans to unveil his agenda for national politics with a new economic model which will focus on farmers Analysts say that KCR will showcase at the national level his success in transforming agriculture with Rythu Bandhu an investment support scheme for farmers which is emulated by the Centre and many states  KCR has been slamming both the Congress and the BJP as storytellers who failed to give direction to the country and guide it on the right path He has been targeting them for failing to create wealth while claiming that his government succeeded in not only creating the wealth but is also distributing the same among the poor and underprivileged sections of the society  It was in 2018 that KCR had floated the idea of a front of likeminded parties as an alternative to both the BJP and the Congress  He had intensified the efforts after retaining power in Telangana in the December 2018 elections  After the massive victory in Assembly elections KCR had appointed his son KT Rama Rao as the working president of the TRS so that he can focus on national politics  He flew from one state to the other to meet leaders of various regional parties He called on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin  He also discussed the idea with HD Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal Secular in Karnataka Hemanth Soren of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Jharkhand Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of the YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh  KCR was even seen as the potential prime ministerial candidate by his party in the event of regional parties emerging as a major bloc in the Lok Sabha  With the BJP retaining power at the Centre with a massive majority KCR had dumped the idea of a front and confined himself to the state  Last year there were reports that KCR was planning to float a national party He however clarified that there was no such proposal for now  He however did not rule out such a proposal He told a party meeting that a decision would be taken at the right time after discussions  KCRs blow hot blow cold stand on the third alternative has come under criticism from various quarters His opponents say he talks of a front only at the time of elections  During the campaign for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation GHMC elections in November last year he had stated that the country definitely needs a new experiment and TRS would be in the forefront to provide the alternative  He had declared that a conclave of likeminded parties will be held in Hyderabad in December  He had also said that Hyderabad would be the epicentre of the movement against the BJP government for its antipeople antifarmer and antilabour policies and the TRS will lead the movement  However KCR adopted complete silence on the proposed front after the GHMC polls  IANS  msarmksk  Only the headline and picture of this report may have been
