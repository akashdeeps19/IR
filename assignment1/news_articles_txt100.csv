1,PayU aims to provide full-stack financial services to its customers - Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/payu-aims-to-provide-full-stack-financial-services-to-its-customers-121083000009_1.html,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com,finance,"Finance, a digital lending player backed by Prosus Ventures, has seen its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) segment double in a year and touch a consumer base of 3 million. The firm, which has seen its lending business touch 70 per cent of pre-Covid levels, is now aiming to provide full-stack to its customers.

Prashanth Ranganathan, chief executive officer (CEO), Finance, believes that in the next five years, the company will be able to create a loan book of $1.5 billion — combined between and PaySense, making it one of the largest digital lenders in the country.

“Over the last year, one of the significant transformations has been that we have managed to bring credit to consumers. We are now systematically looking at bringing more end-to-end digital services to them. has 3 million users, and now, we want to offer other like saving, insurance and wealth management, among others, to this segment. So, starting from BNPL to full stack financial services, that’s how we see ourselves,” said Ranganathan.

BNPL’s offering that it launched in 2017 saw a huge adoption during Covid as it allowed users to make use of deferred payment mechanisms for small-ticket buys in the range of Rs 300-500. The success of this has also propelled the company to offer this mechanism for large-ticket transactions.

“Within BNPL or LazyPay, we have two segments or avatars. The first is a deferred payment product that caters to small-ticket transactions, and it is all about convenient payment. It is not about giving credit. Something similar to a UPI or wallet. We have seen this growing phenomenally for us,” added Ranganathan.

In August of 2020, the company also launched its second version of LazyPay for big-ticket purchases like TV, laptops and refrigerators, among others. Ranganathan said that consumers have had two options of payment: Either use their credit card and convert that to EMIs (equated monthly instalments) or take an EMI/loan from a lending firm.

“BNPL is not a loan nor a credit card that many people feel is an unnecessary hassle due to interest charges. Also, banks have not made it simple for consumers to understand what they are getting into if they use a credit card to take loans. Besides, the new generation does not want to get into long-tenure credit as a utility,” he said.

To give this segment a further boost, will bring in some large merchants to its ecosystem that will go live in a few weeks. “By the end of this year, we will do Rs 80-100 crore per month of lending in this segment as it is massively under-tapped,” said Ranganathan.

So far, the company has disbursed about $300 million in credit and it now wants to add new products. With Covid taking the NBFC segment by surprise last year, many preferred to go slow in lending. PayU, too, adopted the same strategy. With a parent like Prosus, the company did not have issues with access to funds, but it chose to go slow to see how the market performs. Going ahead, the company will focus on three key strategies.

“First, since we have more tech, data science and capital than most, we created a lending OS (operating system), which allows us to fund lending activities of partners. We have a lot of neo-banks, and finance apps coming up and all are saying let us monetise the consumer by giving credit,” he added.

Second, PayU wants to be a much bigger player in the affordability checkout segment. “You will see us doubling and tripling down in checkout finance. It is a big strategic priority for us. And finally, we want to bring to our consumers offerings beyond credit,” he said."

Last year, private equity major Blackstone was also engaged in talks with L&T Finance to buy its mutual fund business for a Rs 3,200 crore deal.

However, it did not materialise as market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India did not give its nod because of the nature of the deal. SEBI does not favour private equity firms owning a majority stake in mutual funds due to their short-term nature.

L&T Finance wants to sell its mutual fund business to monetise non-core businesses. L&T's mutual fund arm is a subsidiary of L&T Finance Holdings Limited. The company has over Rs 75,531 crore quarterly- average assets under management as of June 30, 2021.

Its MF basket comprises 35 funds, including 12 open-ended equity schemes, 12 open-ended debt/fixed income schemes, five hybrid schemes and six close-ended schemes.

Both HSBC and L&T Finance Holdings are yet to issue any statement on the matter.

L&T Finance had reported a 20 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 178 crore for June quarter 2021-22, mainly driven by rural demand for farm equipment. The non-banking financial company registered Rs 148 crore profit in the year-ago period.

With the second wave of Covid-19 coming in April 2021, the country again witnessed a series of lockdowns, which impacted the cash flows of borrowers.

Also, the company, which lends predominantly to the salaried class, was unable to collect from borrowers. This led to a sudden rise in slippages and weakening of solvency and profitability metrics.

Rating agency downgraded its rating for long-term bank lines and non-convertible debentures (NCDs) to “AA” from “AA+”.

The deterioration in the asset quality would further impact GICHF’s earnings profile, and consequently, its internal capital generation.

said with relatively muted growth expectations, the company would not need growth capital in the short term. Its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at 17.14 per cent as on June 30, 2021, which is above the regulatory requirement of 14 per cent.

The company has enough headroom to raise tier II capital as all of the capital is currently in the form of tier I capital.

Gross rose to 11.4 per cent in June 2021 from 5.64 per cent in June 2020. Net shot up from 3.05 per cent in June 2020 to 7.86 per cent in June 2021. Housing loan book has shrunk in 12 months to Rs 12,045 crore in June 2021 from Rs 12,781 crore a year ago, according to a filing with the BSE.

said the company had strengthened underwriting processes in the last two years. Loans given under the new framework have performed better than the earlier originations and the management has taken steps to recover from stressed accounts. The ultimate losses on these accounts would be low, given the secured nature of these loans."

8,IMF loan ‘important’ to its finances: Zambian finance minister - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/8/30/zambias-new-finmin-says-imf-loan-important-to-nations-revival,Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com,finance,"Zambia’s new Finance Minister, Situmbeko Musokotwane, has said in an interview that it was critical to agree to a lending programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) because it would give creditors confidence and the government cheaper and longer financing.

Musokotwane, appointed on Friday by recently elected President Hakainde Hichilema, faces the daunting task of trying to pull the southern African country out of a protracted debt crisis and has pledged to prioritise talks with the IMF.

In an interview aired on Sunday, he told public broadcaster ZNBC he was confident Zambia would get an IMF programme before the end of the year and thereafter restructure its debt.

The government has a $750m Eurobond due next year but says it cannot repay it.

“We don’t have the money to pay back. This is why it is important that we get on (an) IMF (programme) so that we can re-arrange not to pay next year. I am 100 percent confident that it will be done,” he said.

Zambia, Africa’s second-biggest copper producer, became the continent’s first pandemic-era sovereign defaulter in November when it stopped servicing its $3bn in Eurobonds along with almost all its external debt.

A well-respected economist, Musokotwane previously served as finance minister from 2008 to 2011 and oversaw the implementation of Zambia’s last economic programme with the IMF that was concluded shortly before he was appointed to the post. He now faces the task of reviving an economy that shrank 3 percent last year, is buckling under nearly $13bn in foreign loans and has soaring inflation.

But after Hichilema’s landslide election victory this month over incumbent Edgar Lungu, the country’s dollar bonds and Zambian kwacha currency have rallied on hopes the new administration will bring a swift resolution to its debt woes.

Soaring copper prices to the rescue

Elevated prices of copper will aid Musokotwane’s cause: the metal accounts for more than 70 percent of the nation’s export earnings.

Hichilema’s administration aims to more than double copper output to as much as two million metric tonnes yearly by 2026 and ultimately about three million tonnes in 10 years Musokotwane said, referring to the metal used in electric cars as the “new oil”, the Bloomberg news agency reported.

“We are going to push production of copper by creating a good environment for more investment,” he said. “You will be amazed how much foreign exchange this country is going to make. You will not know what to do with the dollars that this country will be receiving.”

The kwacha advanced for a third-straight session on Friday to the strongest level against the dollar since March 2020, when the nation signalled it would restructure its external debt.

Of Zambia’s external debt, some $3bn is in Eurobonds, $3.5bn is bilateral debt, $2.1bn is owed to multilateral lending agencies and another $2.9bn is commercial bank debt.

A quarter of the total is held by either China or Chinese entities via deals shrouded in secrecy clauses, making negotiations for IMF relief particularly tough.

Musokotwane has said that he will present a budget within 90 days of Hichilema’s swearing-in last Tuesday and in the medium- to long-term his priority would be creating jobs."
9,Finance Ministry extends last date for availing GST amnesty scheme till November 30 - Moneycontrol,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/finance-ministry-extends-last-date-for-availing-gst-amnesty-scheme-till-november-30-7404431.html,Moneycontrol,https://www.moneycontrol.com,finance,"Representative Image

The Finance Ministry on Sunday extended the last date to avail the GST amnesty scheme, under which taxpayers have to pay a reduced fee for delayed filing of monthly returns, by three months till November 30.

The GST council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising state ministers, had in May decided to come out with an Amnesty Scheme to provide relief to taxpayers in late fee for pending returns.

The late fee for non-furnishing of GSTR-3B for July 2017 to April 2021 has been capped at Rs 500 per return for those taxpayers who did not have any tax liability. For those with tax liability, a maximum Rs 1,000 per return late fees would be charged, provided such returns are filed by August 31, 2021.

Following the council decision, the Ministry on June 1 notified reduced late fee for non-furnishing Form GSTR-3B for the tax periods from July, 2017 to April, 2021, provided the taxpayer filed the returns for these tax periods by August 31, 2021.

""The last date to avail benefit of the late fee amnesty scheme, has now been extended from existing August 31, 2021 to November 30, 2021,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Based on the multiple representations received, the government also extended the timelines for filing of application for revocation of cancellation of registration to September 30, 2021, where the due date of filing of application for revocation of cancellation of registration falls between March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021.

The filing of Form GSTR-3B and Form GSTR-1/IFF by companies using electronic verification code (EVC), instead of Digital Signature certificate (DSC), has already been enabled for the period from April 27, 2021 to August 31, 2021. This has been further extended to October 31, 2021.

""The extension of the closing date of late fee amnesty scheme and extension of time limit for filing of application for revocation of cancellation of registration will benefit a large number of taxpayers, specially small taxpayers, who could not file their returns in time due to various reasons, mainly because of difficulties caused by Covid-19 pandemic, and whose registrations were cancelled due to the same,"" the Ministry added."
10,Transitioning finance to finance the transition - Top1000funds.com,https://www.top1000funds.com/2021/08/transitioning-finance-to-finance-the-transition/,Top1000funds.com,https://www.top1000funds.com,finance,"World Benchmarking Alliance is developing a series of freely accessible benchmarks that take a systems lens to assessing private sector performance against planetary and societal needs, rather than performance relative to one another, or relative to past performance. Emilie Goodall explains.

Hope or despair? The latest IPCC report has left many of us with mixed feelings, as we face the stark reality of our current global trajectory.

The climate crisis is a system-level issue, with global ramifications that cannot be diversified away. Universal owners have nowhere to hide. Many leading institutional investors, banks and insurers are also exposed in a way that risks creating feedback loops that may far outstrip anything experienced in previous financial crises.

There is no silver bullet; the transition requires many actions, individual and collective, public and private. The recent Finance Climate Action Pathway from the UNFCCC aggregates best practice into hundreds of practical actions financial institutions – by sector – must take, and by when. The report also includes critical recommendations for policy makers and central banks in recognition that ‘there are key elements to economic theory, the practice of financial services and the regulatory framework that encompasses finance, which need to be updated in transitioning finance so it, in turn, can properly finance the transition.’

Financing the transition

Much scrutiny has been on the latter, financing the transition. Specifically, who is financing what. And how they are using their shareholder influence, with, for example, laudable collective investor action on high emitting sectors in recent years. Beyond investor engagement and responsible lending, financial intermediaries influence in many different ways, through advisory functions, underwriting and more. They also influence one another through fiduciary, custodian and other financial functions. This interconnectivity means that all such actions demand scrutiny and action, or the industry reaction risks forever being piecemeal. This holds particularly true for those globally influential financial institutions that dominate the system. We at the World Benchmarking Alliance call these ‘keystone’ actors, building on an analogy from nature.

Transitioning finance

To reorient capital in a lasting way, and at the enormous scale required, we also need to transition finance. Climate is just one of nine planetary boundaries under threat. If we are to live within these planetary boundaries and leave no one behind, significant flows of public and private finance are needed to enable multiple transitions. In the face of science and shifting societal expectations, the industry is under pressure to move away from sustainability as self-defined – one of the reasons ESG rankings and ratings offer such differing results – and towards sustainability as defined by planetary boundaries and internationally recognised human rights and labour standards. The rush of financial institutions signalling net zero intentions marks this paradigm shift underway, as it reflects cross-industry recognition of the impact financial institutions have on people and planet.

Our contribution as the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) to this paradigm shift is a series of freely accessible benchmarks that take a systems lens to assessing private sector performance against planetary and societal needs, rather than performance relative to one another, or relative to past performance. For example, our recent Oil and Gas Benchmark, in partnership with CDP and ADEME, ranked the top 100 keystone oil and gas companies against the IEA’s net zero emissions by 2050 scenario. The stark results demonstrate a system-wide lack of accountability and action. If oil and gas companies exploit the fields already approved for production, those actions alone will consume the global 1.5 degree carbon budget by 2037.

A financial system road map and accountability mechanism

We are now applying this systems lens to keystone actors in the financial system. The recently published Financial System Benchmark draft methodology looks not just at Paris-aligned commitments, but at governance and strategy, respect for biodiversity, and adherence to societal conventions. It builds on best available standards, looking not just at shareholder activities, but at group-wide actions in recognition of financial services’ planetary and societal impact. The resulting benchmark, due 2022, aims to offer a snapshot of the readiness of the financial system for the rapid transitions underway, identifying leaders and laggards amongst the 400 keystone asset owners, asset managers, banks and insurance companies that will be assessed and ranked.

We are in the final phase of an extensive global consultation on the methodology, and invite feedback on the draft methodology until 6 September. The final methodology will be published by end 2021, and offers a roadmap for the transitioning of finance that is just beginning. The resulting benchmark, due in 2022, offers an accountability mechanism that can be used by the 400 being assessed, their clients and suppliers, and regulators and policy makers, to inform further action.

As the IPCC report underlined, the decade of action is actually becoming a much nearer-term window for change. Transitioning the financial system in order to finance the transition is possible, if we choose to act.

Emilie Goodall is financial system lead at the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA). The WBA is on track to benchmark 2000 globally influential companies across seven systems by end 2023: social, climate and energy, digital inclusion, food and agriculture, urban, nature and finance. Spotlight benchmarks are also freely available on human rights, gender, access to seeds and seafood."

13,Bajaj Finance Limited cautions customers against fraudsters offering mandatory insurance policies for availing loan - ANI News,https://www.aninews.in/news/business/business/bajaj-finance-limited-cautions-customers-against-fraudsters-offering-mandatory-insurance-policies-for-availing-loan20210830164623,ANI News,https://www.aninews.in,finance,"Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], August 30 (ANI/NewsVoir): Bajaj Finance Limited, the lending and investment arm of Bajaj Finserv, cautions its customers and the public at large to stay vigilant against fake loans offered by fraudsters in exchange of an insurance policy purchase.

Fraudsters are duping the public:

(i) by luring them to compulsorily buy life insurance as a pre-condition to avail a loan

(ii) by impersonating to be a representative of Bajaj Finance Ltd. and misguiding the public to buy an insurance policy by stating that the premium amount shall be some percent of the loan amount desired by potential borrowers.

The modus operandi is mostly as under:

The insurance policy is used as a bait by the fraudster who ensures that the victim receives all insurance documents from the insurance company

The Fraudster stays in contact with the victim for a long time and cites excuses for the delay in the loan disbursal process

Most insurance policies have a 90 days free look period for insurance policy, where the customer can cancel the policy, and the premium will be refunded. After the said free look period is over, the fraudster will stop answering the victim

It is thereafter that the victim realises about the suspicious conduct of fraudster and reaches out to Bajaj Finance Ltd.

Bajaj Finance Ltd., has alerted its customer through its social media handles to not to fall for such traps by fraudsters. The post states:

'Loan lenekeliye life insurance policy purchase karnazaroorihai'. Aur ye jhoothai!. Always remember that Bajaj Finance Ltd., does not require you to make a compulsory purchase of any other products to avail a loan. Don't fall into such traps!

Twitter: twitter.com/Bajaj_Finance/status/1430494743247478784

Bajaj Finance Ltd., cautions its customers and the public at large that any person in need of loans should approach its nearest branch or check the company's official website at www.bajajfinserv.in, and never engage with any unofficial/unknown intermediaries/unidentified fraudsters. Through various channels, the Company is driving awareness initiatives against such fraudulent incidents and has mentioned clear directives on the loan availing and sanctioning process.

14,Buy now pay later and its financial inclusion scope - Mint,https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/buy-now-pay-later-and-its-financial-inclusion-scope-11630257796333.html,Mint,https://www.livemint.com,finance,"US fintech giant Square recently announced an all-stock acquisition of ‘buy now pay later’ (BNPL) leader Afterpay. The deal, at $29 billion, was at a whopping 30% premium to its previous closing price. While the BNPL industry has seen rapid growth in developed markets for the past few years, this acquisition proves that BNPL is the future of payments globally and more so for developing markets such as India.

Launched in 2015 by Afterpay in Australia, BNPL is a way for users to pay later for their e-commerce buys with limited credit checks and a slick payment experience. The product found huge acceptance among millennials, given the growing mistrust of traditional credit products due to their history of lack of transparency in operations and onerous costs of debt. BNPL allowed these young adults to avoid credit and yet get a breather on their cash flow.

Over the years, Afterpay became the market leader in Australia and New Zealand. Similarly, Klarna emerged in Europe and Affirm blossomed in the US even as Afterpay launched in the US, too. All these companies have become market leaders in their respective geographies and have seen strong investor interest reflecting in their valuations.

We, at MobiKwik, believe that the convenience of payments, combined with the benefits of pay later, is an extremely powerful strategy, one that will shape the future of fintech and democratize credit. When the BNPL category creator Afterpay is acquired by the payments behemoth Square, you know that this strategy is not a figment of imagination, but truly a validated model that people are willing to put their money and future behind.

The payments market in the US is booming with large players such as PayPal and Square each participating with their unique models. PayPal is a notable incumbent which launched a pay later product Pay in 4, while others have not really embraced the BNPL opportunity, yet. Square plays on both sides of the payment ecosystem with its large merchant network and a vibrant consumer base on its Cash app. Using Afterpay’s pay later product to connect its consumer base with its merchant base should bring exponential scale and stickiness to the Square-Afterpay platform. Rather than imitating PayPal and developing a product in-house, Square took the acquisition route, acquiring Afterpay.

The fact that Square, with its deep pockets, and talented technology teams felt it was too late to build a product in-house says a lot about the rapid rise of BNPL. I am sure this bold bet on part of Square founder Jack Dorsey and company will play the title role in their plans of market/world dominance and the premium paid to add Afterpay to their arsenal will be totally worth it. The value proposition of Afterpay is such that some analysts have wondered if there will be competitive bids from other players.

Do note that compared with developed markets such as Canada, Japan, US and UK, where credit card penetration is 83%, 68%, 66% and 65%, respectively, India’s credit card penetration remains significantly lower than global peers at 3.5%. This shows the paucity in availability of credit and the inherent opportunity for BNPL to fill the void. Overall, the segment is expected to grow 15x from $3.5 billion in 2021 to $45 billion-$50 billion by 2026.

In the developed markets, BNPL grew because the new generation did not want a credit card with layers of hidden fees from traditional financial institutions. In developing markets such as South Asia and South America, credit is yet to reach the masses and only a select few have access to it. Tech platforms can bring huge efficiency to distribution in these markets. The analogy is simple—there are existing financial highways in place such as US and BNPL will replace many of them. In India, such futuristic highways will be built from scratch using mobile payments and BNPL, rapidly democratizing payments, credit and all of fintech.

BNPL for daily life payments (e-commerce, travel, groceries, bills) is the only way to deliver financial freedom to millions of Indians.

This was among the key conclusions of the 15th IsDB Global Forum on Islamic Finance, held virtually on 28 August 2021.

The IsDB Institute (IsDBI) organized the forum under the theme, “The Role of Islamic Finance in Post-COVID19 Economic Recovery of IsDB MCs”, as part of the side events of the 2021 IsDB Group Annual Meeting. The forum brought together senior development practitioners and private sector experts from the Republic of Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Mauritania, IsDB Group, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

In his speech at the opening of the forum, H.E. Dr. Muhammad Al Jasser, Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) President and Chairman of the IsDB Group, noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated poverty and stalled human development, adding that countries and development partners must come together to identify strategies for achieving a sustainable recovery.

“Human development is a crucial goal of IsDB to maintain and promote human dignity in its Member Countries. Achieving this goal starts with reducing all forms of poverty, particularly in health and education, which are essential for building human capital,” Dr. Al Jasser said.

Underlining the significance of infrastructure investments for developing economies, H.E. Dr. Al Jasser stated that the growing Islamic finance industry could serve as an essential source of finance for infrastructure development in developing countries and emerging markets.

“We welcome the joint World Bank–IsDB effort to develop the Islamic Finance for Infrastructure PPP Projects reference Guide, which aims to shed light on the essential aspects of Islamic finance related to infrastructure public-private partnerships,” he added.

Earlier, Acting Director General of the IsDB Institute, Dr. Sami Al-Suwailem, in his welcome remarks, thanked H.E. Dr. Al Jasser and the participants of the forum. He added that “the forum this year aimed to integrate the principles of Islamic finance with the search for solutions for economic challenges facing the IsDB Member Countries.”

Two keynote speeches were delivered by Dr. Bambang Susantono, Vice President at the Asian Development Bank, and Mr. Imad Fakhoury, Global Director, Infrastructure Finance, PPP and Guarantees (IPG) Group, World Bank.

Dr. Susantono spoke on how Islamic finance can help fill the financing gap required to kickstart the economic recovery post-COVID-19, while Mr. Fakhoury focused on promoting public-private partnerships for infrastructure financing in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

Following the keynote speeches, two panel sessions were held. The first session highlighted the extent of multidimensional poverty in IsDB Member Countries and the adverse impacts of COVID-19.

The panel discussants were Mr. Norkulov Ilkhom, First Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction, Uzbekistan; Dr. Sabina Alkire, Director, Oxford Poverty, and Human Development Initiative; Ms. Matilda Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative in Uzbekistan; Mr. El Yass Ould Didi, Director of Demographic and Social Statistics, Office of National Statistics, Mauritania; and Mr. Khemais El-Gazzah, Senior Advisor to the Director General of the Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development (ISFD).

The second panel discussed Islamic finance public-private partnerships as a tool to mobilize resources to support the economic recovery efforts. The panelists were Ms. Fatouma Toure Ibrahima, Practice Manager, PPP Group Infrastructure Finance, PPPs and Guarantees (IPG) Group, World Bank; Mr. Nadir Nuritdinov, Deputy Director of Uzbekistan PPP Development Agency; Mr. Sohail Kashif, Chief Financial Officer, Foundation Wind Energy Limited, Pakistan; and Mr. Hassan Idris, Senior Legal Counsel, Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC).

Altus Power – an investor, owner, and operator of clean energy projects – announced that it had acquired a 79 MW portfolio of solar projects operating across seven U.S. states. The portfolio was acquired from private equity funds managed by True Green Capital Management. The acquired solar portfolio includes sites in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New York, and Tennessee. The commercial and industrial projects, including rooftop, ground-mount, and carport solar arrays, deliver clean electricity via long-term contracts to predominantly investment-grade customers, including municipalities, commercial entities, and utilities.

Clearway Energy, an entity of Global Infrastructure Partners, announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 50% equity interest in the Utah solar portfolio that it does not currently own for $335 million. The Utah solar portfolio consists of seven utility-scale solar projects located in Utah representing 530 MW of capacity that achieved commercial operations in 2016. The assets within the portfolio sell power subject to 20-year PPAs with PacifiCorp that have approximately 15 years remaining under the agreements. Subject to customary closing conditions, the company expects to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2021.

TEESS, a 50:50 joint venture company established by TotalEnergies and Envision Group, has announced the financial close for the first part of a total $80 million non-recourse debt for a 170 MW solar portfolio in China. The lenders include BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Natixis, and Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank. The lending marks the first international non-recourse project financing in China’s renewable sector.

German bank Berenberg, through its Berenberg Green Energy Junior Debt Fund III, has agreed to finance the late-stage development of Elgin Energy’s 1,360 MW solar portfolio of around 50 solar projects across Ireland and the UK. Berenberg will provide a total of €36 million (~$43 million) in credit to the projects, which will be drawn over three years. Elgin Energy will develop the projects through its established partnerships with third parties. The first projects from the portfolio are expected to be ready to build by the fourth quarter of 2022.

Sonnedix, a solar independent power producer, has completed the acquisition of an 11.4 MW solar PV portfolio in Italy from the Swiss company ZHC Holding. The portfolio consists of 10 ground-mounted solar PV projects in operations since 2010/2012. The projects are located in Italy’s Tuscany and Apulia regions, and they all benefit from the Italian Conto Energia FiT regime. On this transaction, Sonnedix was advised by RaffaelliSegreti (legal), Duff&Phelps (Tech), RSM Studio Palea Lauri Gerla (Tax and financial).

Korea Midland Power (KOMIPO) has entered a deal to finance a $200 million Elara solar PV project in the U.S. The project calls for the construction of a 130 MW solar PV project in Frio County, Texas. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (MOLIT) leads the project, and Hanwha Asset Management participates as a financial investor. Morgan Stanly and MMA Energy Capital are partaking as tax equity investor and lender, respectively.

NextEra Energy Partners, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, a renewable energy company focused on solar and wind power, announced that it had completed its previously announced acquisition of a 391 MW portfolio of four operating wind assets located in California and New Hampshire. The assets included are Alta Wind VIII, 150 MW wind generating facility in California; Windstar, 120 MW wind generating facility in California; Coram, 22 MW wind generating facility in California; Granite, 99 MW wind generating facility in New Hampshire.

With three awards in Western Europe, BBVA was the bank with the highest number of awards in this region.

These awards recognize “global and regional leadership in Sustainable Finance for initiatives designed to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change and help build a more sustainable future for humanity,” according to the publication.

The winners were selected based on their environmental and social achievements, and the magazine particularly valued aspects related to support for social initiatives; sustainable financing globally and in emerging markets; and efforts in the issuance of sustainable (green and social) bonds.

“This award recognizes our efforts to support, accompany and finance, especially in those communities that need it most in many countries where we have a significant presence. In this sense, as part of our sustainability strategy, inclusive growth is critical, and greater education and financial inclusion have a favorable impact on the well-being and sustained economic progress of these communities. BBVA allocated 142 million euros to social initiatives alone in 2020,” said Antonio Ballabriga, BBVA's Global Head of Responsible Business.

In February 2021, the English-language publication recognized BBVA as the world's best investment bank in sustainable finance.

In addition, through the BBVA Microfinance Foundation, it promotes the sustainable development of low-income people through financial services, financial education and technical training to boost their small businesses. In its more than ten years of history, it has supported 5 million entrepreneurs through its banks in five Latin American countries, with disbursements of more than US$15.2 billion.

The BBVA Microfinance Foundation (BBVAMF) has been recognized by the OECD as the leading foundation in Latin America in terms of its contribution to development, and the second in the world only after the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

In 2020, BBVA launched its ‘COVID-19' Social Response’ Plan, equipped with €35.7 million to help society as a whole. More than 3.5 million people have directly benefited from these initiatives, in addition to measures to support customers, such as moratoriums and publicly guaranteed loans.

BBVA is the most sustainable bank in Europe and the second most sustainable in the world, according to DJSI.

100,Monday Musings: Politics of the ‘yatra’ embedded in DNA of all parties - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-politics-of-the-yatra-embedded-in-dna-of-all-parties-101630322683840.html,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com,politics,"During July 2019, Maharashtra was witnessing a moderate monsoon, with rain taking intermittent breaks, when the state’s political atmosphere began to heat up, as the state was heading for assembly elections in the next four months.

That was when Aaditya Thackeray, then just a Yuva Sena leader, decided to undertake a statewide yatra to thank the people who voted for the Shiv Sena in the recently held Lok Sabha elections, and to seek their blessings for the upcoming Assembly elections.

Not to mention, that was also called a Jan Ashirwad yatra. Even as the Shiv Sena did not get the seats it targeted, the yatra brought political stature to Aaditya, who later became a cabinet minister in Maharashtra.

While the latest Jan Ashirwad yatra undertaken by BJP leader and Union minister Narayan Rane had nothing in common with that of Thackeray’s, both, like many others, had strong political motives.

If there’s a common thread through the political parties of India, of yatras or long journeys clubbed with rallies, speeches and a political motive.

In Maharashtra, yatras have done magic, particularly for the BJP when it was not in the game in state politics.

In the mid-1990s, late BJP leader Gopinath Munde had undertaken a major journey, what was then called a Sangharsh yatra (journey of struggle).

If Munde, along with party colleague, the late Pramod Mahajan, was responsible for the BJP’s meteoric rise in Maharashtra, his Sangharsh Yatra is believed to have contributed significantly to the victory of the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in the 1995 state assembly elections.

Through whirlwind statewide tours, Munde addressed more than 150 meetings, exposing various scams of the Congress-led government, which went on defensive.

Later in 2014, Munde’s daughter Pankaja Palve-Munde led another 14-day tour – this time called the “Punha Ekda Sangharsh Yatra (Once again, Journey of struggle) - on the lines of a similar expedition to her father’s, to evoke his memories.

Her tour came days after the sudden demise of her father that shook state BJP unit.

It’s not just BJP leaders who have undertaken such yatras. Parties of all hues have hit the streets with roadshows to rev up their message on topics dominating the news cycle or divert attention from issues that are problematic.

Does such a yatra really help any leader to turn the tide in his favour? The answer can be mixed, even as it helps politicians to stir up the atmosphere, galvanise the cadre and create a buzz. After all, it allows politicians to come to peoples’ doorsteps instead of the other way round.

This is probably the reason that the response yatras receive is often amazing and helps in political mobilisation.

At the same time, the grandeur of a yatra with a focused theme also helps connect better with the target audience.

Just before 2019 assembly polls, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) led by Sharad Pawar embarked on similar expedition. Called the ‘’Shivswarajya Yatra’’, the aim was to launch a mass outreach programme, starting from Shivneri Fort in Pune’s Junnar taluka, the birth place of Chhatrapati Shivaji.

The mother of all yatras that gave a new lifeline to the BJP in the early 1990s was the one taken out by party patriarch LK Advani. The Rath Yatra on the Ram Mandir issue helped the BJP achieve power at the Centre later. That yatra was also identified by Advani’s rivals for arousing communal passions that led to the demolition of the Babri Masjid.

Yatras existed even before that. Originally, Mahatma Gandhi popularised the concept during the freedom struggle, though later it was used as a political instrument by leaders.

Accordingly, for Rane, the goal is clear - to regain his lost grip over the Konkan and also to help his party the BJP, wrest power in the upcoming Brihan Mumbai elections.

However, controversy generated over Rane’s “slapping the chief minister” comments may have helped Uddhav Thackeray more, as it galvanised the Shiv Sainiks, who perform better on the streets than through any government.

102,How past reconstructions of Somnath Temple have reflected politics of the time - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/research/how-past-reconstructions-of-somnath-temple-have-reflected-politics-of-the-time-7477430/,The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com,politics,"Earlier this month, as PM Narendra Modi inaugurated a range of projects at the Somnath Temple in Gujarat, he cited the number of times it was raided and how it re-emerged every single time. Such forces and empires “can become dominant for some time in a given era, but can never become permanent. They cannot keep humanity suppressed for long,” he said while virtually laying down the foundation stone of the Parvati Temple at Somnath. “This was as true when some tyrannical forces were razing Somnath (temple) as it is today, when the world is apprehensive of such ideologies.”

While Modi’s speech was aimed at the recent takeover of Afghanistan by Taliban forces, the narrative of the Somnath Temple’s destruction and resurrection has indeed served political purposes, both during the colonial period and in an independent India.

Located at Veraval in the western coast of Gujarat, the Somnath Temple is believed to be the first among the 12 jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. The site, which was part of the erstwhile princely state of Junagadh, was also connected to Lord Krishna. The political history of the shrine is traced back to a thousand years when in 1024 CE, during the reign of the Chalukya king Bhima I it was attacked by Turkik ruler Mahmud of Ghazni. An archaeological report submitted in 1950 by the department of archaeology, headed by B K Thapar, suggests that following the demolition by Ghazni, the temple was rebuilt once again by Hindu rulers. It was once again desecrated in 1297 CE when Alaf Khan, a general of the Khilji rulers in Delhi, attacked it. In the next few centuries, the temple was rebuilt on multiple occasions and desecrated in 1349 CE, 1413 CE and 1459 CE. It was once again demolished in 1699 by Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, suggests the report as cited by anthropologist Peter van der Veer in a 1992 research paper. Finally, in 1783, the Maratha queen Ahalyabai is known to have erected a shrine for Somnath a little distance away from the ruins of the old temple.

Van der Veer explains that this narrative did everything to “fill with tools and vocabulary of modern empirical science some lacunae of a story already well established.” He writes: “The story remains the same, and it is the story of perennial enmity between Muslim iconoclasts and Hindu idol-worshippers.”

The historical account of the Somnath Temple by the department of archaeology was sketched out in response to Congress leader K M Munshi’s proposal to reconstruct the temple in the years soon following the Independence of the country. But even under the British, a narrative of the destruction and rescue of the Somnath Temple was put to use most effectively for political purposes.

Proclamation of the Gates

By the 19th century, readings of the event from Turko-Persian sources were becoming very popular among colonial interpreters of Indian history. They came to argue that the attack of Somnath by Mahmud was a cause of trauma for the Hindus. Historian Romila Thapar in her book, ‘Somnatha: The many voices of a history’ (2008), suggests that the colonial interest in the story grew out of two factors. “By focusing on the Turko-Persian representation of the event, the antagonism between Hindus and Muslims could be highlighted; and the statement that Mahmud found India a garden but converted it into a desert would require that the colonial power replant the desert, converting it into a garden and, in this process, emphasizing the destructiveness of Mahmud and of subsequent Muslim rule,” she writes.

She notes that while such a reading suited the European understanding of Islam at the time, it ignored the fact that in the historical context the ruling elite was not just acting on the behest of their religion. Thapar argues that unlike what the colonisers interpreted, none of the sources in fact spoke of a hostile reaction from the Hindus or of any such trauma created among them. Other sources in Sanskrit and regional languages too described the event in the traditional manner of battling enemies rather than in religious terms.

In 1852, Lord Ellenborough, who was then the governor-general, issued what came to be known as the ‘Proclamation of the Gates’. “He had heard that the sandalwood gates of the Somnatha temple had been taken back to Ghazni by Mahmud and had been placed at the entrance to his mausoleum. So he decided that the gates had to be brought back to Somnatha,” notes Thapar.

Interestingly, it remains unclear as to how and where Ellenborough found this bit of historical information since no source happens to mention it. When the British retook Kabul and Ghazni in the Anglo-Afghan war of 1942, the gates became a symbol of the conquest of Afghanistan. Ellenborough’s proclamation, which was primarily addressed to the chiefs and princes of northern and western India, emphasised on the “insult” of 800 years that was finally being avenged.

On the instruction of Ellenborough, General William Nott removed the gates in September 1842 and the 6th Jat Light Infantry was tasked with carrying it back to India. However, once they reached India and upon examination, the gates were found to not have been of Indian workmanship. They were also made of Deodar wood which is native to Ghazni, rather than sandalwood. Consequently, they were kept in the Agra Fort where they remain till date.

The reconstruction of Somnath in 1950-51

The colonial interpretation of the Indian past was carried forward by the anti-colonial nationalist leaders as well.

In the years preceding the independence of India, Munshi, on visiting the ruins of the ancient temple, expressed disappointment at the nation’s inability to protect the shrine. Recollecting his visit to the ruins in 1922, Munishi in his book, “Somnatha: The shrine eternal” (1976) writes, “My heart was full of veneration and shame. Millions have worshipped and worship today, Shri Krishna as ‘God himself’. Thousands, in every generation, had gained prestige or made money in his name as his representatives on earth. But the nation had fallen low; no one dared to raise his voice to rescue the sacred spot where once his mortal remains had been consigned to flames.”

Van der Veer in his work explains that Munshi’s writing equated the decline of the temple in 1024CE to the decline of the Hindu nation and the suppression of the Hindu population by the Nawabs of Junagadh. He also declared his desire to reconstruct the Somnath Temple at the site.

At the time of Independence, the Nawab of Junagadh decided to accede to Pakistan, despite the Hindu majority in his kingdom. The Indian National Congress reacted by forming a parallel government that led to an uprising by the people of Junagadh against the Nawab. Consequently, the Nawab fled to Pakistan and his dewan invited the Indian Army to Junagadh and handed over its administration to the Indian union.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, then the home minister of India, visited Junagadh on November 12, 1947 and in a huge public meeting announced the reconstruction of the Somnath Temple. “On this auspicious day of the new year, we have decided that Somnatha should be reconstructed. You, people of Saurashtra, should do your best. This is a holy task in which all should participate,” he said as Van der Veer cites in his work.

When Munshi along with Patel had approached Gandhi to propose the reconstruction of the temple, the latter is supposed to have agreed but laid out that “let the people and not the government bear the expenditure”. Accordingly, a trust was created with Munshi as its chairman.

Van der Veer notes that while money had indeed not been directly spent by the government of India, there is no doubt about the support the project received from state institutions. “The government of India and the Saurashtra government each had two representatives on the board of trustees. An advisory committee was set up with Munshi as chairman and the director-general of archaeology as convenor,” he writes.

With the death of Patel in 1950, the responsibility of building the temple fell on Munshi’s shoulders. But he was not without opposition in his plans for this new construction. While the archaeologists wished to preserve the ruins, Munshi wanted the site to be a place of worship and living tradition for the ‘Hindu nation’.

Then there was also the prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was strongly opposed to Munshi associating the reconstruction of the temple with the government of India. As Thapar notes, for Nehru “such an activity was unacceptable as government activity and inimical to the policy of a secular government ruling a secular state.”

In a letter addressed to the chief ministers on May 2, 1951, Nehru wrote:

You must have read about the coming ceremonies at Somnath temple. Many people have been attracted to this and some of my colleagues are even associated with it in their individual capacities. But it should be clearly understood that this function is not governmental and the Government of India as such has nothing to do with it. While it is easy to understand a certain measure of public support to this venture we have to remember that we must not do anything which comes in the way of our State being secular. That is the basis of our Constitution and Governments therefore, should refrain from associating themselves with anything which tends to affect the secular character of our State. There, are, unfortunately, many communal tendencies at work in India today and we have to be on our guard against them. It is important that Governments should keep the secular and non-communal ideal always before them. (as cited by Thapar).

Nehru was also against president Rajendra Prasad visiting the inaugural ceremony of the temple. “I confess that I do not like the idea of your associating yourself with a spectacular opening of the Somnath temple. This is not merely visiting a temple, which can certainly be done by you or anyone else, but rather participating in a significant function which unfortunately has a number of implications. Personally, I thought that this was no time to lay stress on large-scale building operations at Somnath. This could have been done gradually and more effectively later. However, this has been done. I feel that it would be better if you did not preside over this function,” he wrote in a letter to Prasad.

Prasad, however, ignored Nehru’s advice and participated in the ceremony. In his speech at Somnath, Prasad emphasised on the Gandhian value of inter-faith harmony. He also pointed out that to reconstruct the temple was “not to open old wounds”, but rather “to help each caste and community obtain full freedom”.

Nehru was equally displeased with reports of the Saurashtra government contributing a substantial amount of money to the building of the temple. He believed that at a time when the government had stopped expenditure on education, health and other beneficent services due to lack of funds, it seemed odd for a state government to be spending on temple building.

Thapar writes that Nehru’s concern was not just with the Somnath Temple and it being rebuilt. “He was underlining the larger view of the nature of the Indian state and society after independence and was demanding a commitment to democracy and secularism.”

104,KCR may renew efforts for third alternative in national politics - Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/kcr-may-renew-efforts-for-third-alternative-in-national-politics-121082900095_1.html,Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com,politics,"Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao may revive his idea of a federal front and gear up to play a key role in as he is all set to lay the foundation stone for the office of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in New Delhi next week.

The development is not without significance and it comes at a time when Rao has just launched the 'Dalit Bandhu' scheme, which, he hopes, will become a torchbearer for empowerment of Dalits across the country.

Looking to turn the event into a show of strength, he will be leading a team of over 100 leaders to the capital. All MPs of TRS, state ministers, state legislators and members of the party executive will attend the ceremony on September 2.

The foundation stone laying ceremony has led to speculations in political circles that KCR, as the TRS supremo is popularly known, will formally announce his entry into the

KCR's ambition to play a key role in the national is well-known. He wants to cobble up a front with like-minded parties as an alternative to both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, which according to him, proved to be utter flops in governing the country.

Though there are still more than two-and-a-half years to go for the Lok Sabha elections, political analysts say may use the event to renew his efforts to forge an alternative front.

Political observers say will highlight the rapid strides Telangana has made in various sectors during the last seven years. He claims that the country's youngest state has emerged as a role model for all the states in a short span of time.

The development also comes at a time when has launched what he calls a revolutionary scheme for social and economic empowerment of Dalits.

The regional satrap is projecting 'Dalit Bandhu' as a model scheme and is confident that it will become a torch-bearer for the upliftment of Dalits across the country.

Under the scheme, launched on pilot basis in the Huzurabad Assembly constituency in Karimnagar district, every Dalit family will get Rs 10 lakh as grant and they will be free to choose their profession, self-employment or businesses, for utilising the funds.

KCR has already announced that he is ready to spend Rs 1.75 lakh crore on the scheme to cover all 17 lakh Dalit families in the state. He believes that the scheme will be a big game changer for Dalits and eliminate social discrimination against them.

The TRS chief, who has been talking of providing an alternative to the BJP and the Congress for the last 3-4 years, will put forth the successful Telangana model before the country and promise to replicate the same at the national level.

TRS leaders say KCR will try to highlight how his government has delivered on various fronts in a short span of time to transform an arid region into a lush green and prosperous state.

With a growth rate and per capita income higher than the national average and continuing impressive growth even during the Covid-19 pandemic, Telangana is already claiming to be a role model for other states.

The TRS founder plans to unveil his agenda for national politics with a new economic model, which will focus on farmers. Analysts say that KCR will showcase at the national level his success in transforming agriculture with 'Rythu Bandhu', an investment support scheme for farmers which is emulated by the Centre and many states.

KCR has been slamming both the Congress and the BJP as 'storytellers' who failed to give direction to the country and guide it on the right path. He has been targeting them for failing to create wealth while claiming that his government succeeded in not only creating the wealth, but is also distributing the same among the poor and underprivileged sections of the society.

It was in 2018 that KCR had floated the idea of a front of like-minded parties as an alternative to both the BJP and the Congress.

He had intensified the efforts after retaining power in Telangana in the December 2018 elections.

After the massive victory in Assembly elections, KCR had appointed his son K.T. Rama Rao as the working president of the TRS so that he can focus on national politics.

He flew from one state to the other to meet leaders of various regional parties. He called on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin.

He also discussed the idea with H.D. Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka, Hemanth Soren of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Jharkhand, Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, and Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy of the YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh.

KCR was even seen as the potential prime ministerial candidate by his party in the event of regional parties emerging as a major bloc in the Lok Sabha.

With the BJP retaining power at the Centre with a massive majority, KCR had dumped the idea of a front and confined himself to the state.

Last year, there were reports that KCR was planning to float a national party. He, however, clarified that there was no such proposal for now.

He, however, did not rule out such a proposal. He told a party meeting that a decision would be taken at the right time after discussions.

KCR's blow hot blow cold stand on the third alternative has come under criticism from various quarters. His opponents say he talks of a front only at the time of elections.

During the campaign for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections in November last year, he had stated that the country definitely needs a new experiment and TRS would be in the forefront to provide the alternative.

He had declared that a conclave of like-minded parties will be held in Hyderabad in December.

He had also said that Hyderabad would be the epicentre of the movement against the BJP government for its 'anti-people', 'anti-farmer' and 'anti-labour' policies, and the TRS will lead the movement.

However, KCR adopted complete silence on the proposed front after the GHMC polls.

From Qurratulain Hyder through Shashi Tharoor to Vikram Seth, many have written their own great Indian novels, works of considerable merit, but not the great Indian novel.

Such is the diversity of lands, people and cultures in India that most novels of this kind remain regional in focus, however ambitious they may be in scale. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata/Bengal, Kerala, and western India have usually provided settings and characters in Indian English novels. But Uttar Pradesh, an area which has wielded considerable political influence in independent India, has held out its appeal to a host of Hindi and Urdu writers and poets, but has only occasionally appeared in Indian English fiction.

One can think of Lucknow in Attia Hosain’s Sunlight on a Broken Column, Lucknow and Benaras in Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy, Benaras in Pankaj Mishra’s The Romantics, and western UP, though cursorily, in Mirza Waheed’s Tell Her Everything. But Uttar Pradesh’s geography and its political significance has largely been absent in Indian English novels.

Observing the quotidian

The Politician is unabashedly a north Indian novel, more specifically a novel about a specific region in central Uttar Pradesh. Written in a realistic mode, not trying too hard to embellish the narrative with literary texture, it provides a glimpse into the political culture of this region. All characters in the novel obviously speak Hindi – and the novel is imbued with a Hindi-speaking culture – but such is the quality of Devesh Verma’s expressive prose that The Politician might appear a lesser work if rendered into Hindi, losing its novelty and freshness.

Every bit a twenty-first century Indian English novel, it neither tries to write back to a centre nor cares for a western reader. The novel captures both the energy and the chaos that characterise life in small towns in Uttar Pradesh, showing effortlessly both the machinations of power politics and mounds of filth.

The narrator in The Politician is certainly a great observer of the ordinary, day-to-day life in Uttar Pradesh directing the reader’s gaze to the poor children “who wanted to push the jeep” quarrelling among themselves, or constantly sniffling “to hold back the snot that would peek through before being drawn back in quickly”; a candidate for a job surprising a big official “by his correct use of the conjunction ‘lest’”, or the landline phones always developing snags, and the telephone officials’ indifference to people’s complaints.

In many places, the description of filth – of “clogged urine outlet, an assortment of faecal mounds of various sizes and colour” – fills up the narrative. EM Forster had been reminded of the virtue of reticence in western literature while thinking of the filth and the description of bowel movements in Mulk Raj Anand’s Untouchable. It is another matter that HG Wells discovered James Joyce’s “cloacal obsession” in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, while another reviewer found Dublin too ugly in the great modernist’s work.

Verma, writing in the 21st century, does not have to think about reticence. All chaos and disorder in mofussil India, which is routine and to which people have become accustomed, is captured by his expressive prose at these moments. Even the description of filth is treated with humour. Thus, in a choice between an extraordinarily filthy and foul-smelling urinal which displays the picture of a “smiling prime minister with a rosebud in the buttonhole of his white khadi waistcoat” and the boundary wall, people make for the boundary wall.

Caste and crew

The energy latent in the political culture of Uttar Pradesh is the main subject of The Politician. The communal angle of this political culture has interested many novelists, but The Politician brings the elephant of caste arithmetic into the world of English novel, especially the relationship of caste and politics in the Hindi heartland.

Mulk Raj Anand, wedded to his social realism, brought out the issue of caste in Untouchable. Arundhati Roy brought in the caste angle through the forbidden relationship of Ammu Ipe and Velutha in The God of Small Things. Caste obviously is an important subject in Dalit literature. But novels about a specific backward caste, in this case Kurmis of Western UP, have been non-existent in Indian English fiction.

The Politician views entire election campaigns for parliamentary and assembly seats from the angle of Kurmi influence in and around Fatehpur and Kanpur. This is also seen in the larger national politics of the Congress and the non-Congress parties, before the ascendancy of right-wing politics. Criticism of Brahminical influence in Indian politics completes this picture.

In treating political themes The Politician also sets up a dialogue between different political ideologies living up to the polyphonic character of a novel. It dwells on the personalities and ideas of a number of major Indian political figures, like Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Morarji Desai, and Jayaprakash Narayan, and minor ones like Raj Narayan, Banarsi Das Gupta, and Sampoornanand.

Ambedkar, Periyar and Phule are referred to for their radical political views in the discussions of characters about caste. Some other major characters in the novel are based on real political figures. Baran Singh appears to have been modelled on former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, and Sansadji on the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna.

Characters and narratives

Taking the reader back and forth in time, Kartik Verma, the narrator who is the head at a new TV news channel, is also a minor character in the novel. The notes and diaries left for him by his deceased friend Deena give him privileged access into the world of Ram Mohan, Deena’s father and the central character in The Politician, turning the novel into a kind of third person narrative, though sometimes interrupted by his first person narration.

But the point of view in the novel is that of Deena, a sensitive soul in a ruthless world, mediated by Kartik, his alternative self, who studied with Deena at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Deena’s peace-loving nature, his devotion to vegetarianism, his tender self, and his inability to adjust to the cruelty and viciousness in the world are aspects of the latent ethos of the novel contrasting beautifully with the novel’s overt cynicism.

The first two sentences of the novel, also used on the book jacket, immediately pull the reader into the narrative: “I was about to leave for work when the telephone rang. Deena was dead.” Did we hear the echo of the opening sentence of Camus’ Outsider: “Mother died today”?

Ram Mohan, a college teacher of Hindi and a scholar who has written a book of Hindi grammar, nurses a political ambition which is further whetted by his political mentors. However, despite being the main character in the novel, Ram Mohan’s character appears very thin for almost two thirds of the novel. It is only in the final third that he is fully realised, letting readers make their judgment about him.

Whatever idealism he might have aroused earlier is completely punctured. His authoritarian and patriarchal thinking is outweighed only by his hypocritical morality. He evinces no active virtue through the 350-and-odd pages of the novel. The secondary characters appear more interesting. Is it because many of them are inspired by real life figures? Baran Singh’s ideas, beliefs, and habits are sharply drawn. Dixit ji with his novel morality sticks in the mind. Sansadji’s near and distant presence, his vacillations and permanent promise to deliver also hold the narrative beautifully.

History and fiction

No novel can escape history – however it may try to give history the slip. Contrarily, novels may faithfully use actual political and historical events and situations, but still cannot pass as history as novels do what only they can, not the textbooks of history. The success of Sunlight on a Broken Column or, for that matter, Milan Kundera’s and Amitav Ghosh’s novels is largely due to their fine blending of history and the main narrative.

The movement from history to narrative and vice versa is seamless in Sunlight and Unbearable Lightness of Being, to take just two examples. This seamlessness deserts The Politician at some places where the reporting of actual historical events and developments in independent India has an obtrusive presence.

Most poetic and novelistic creations defamiliarise the familiar, the mundane, the everyday. The treatment of distant events in history achieves a defamiliarising effect more easily than more recent historical developments, unless used as a context for the main narrative. Events like the China War, Nehru’s politics, and Indira Gandhi’s taking over the Congress are too fresh in public memory, permanently kept on the boil by an overzealous Indian media and speeches of leaders.

But, most certainly there are varied interpretive communities of readers in terms of age groups, regions, nationalities and gender. The Politician will achieve a defamiliarising effect for the new generation of readers, and an international audience, not necessarily based in India. The role of relatively marginal political figures like Charan Singh or Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna is almost forgotten today, and they may not even be recognised by most readers behind their fictional personas.

It is not even required to know the actual people a novelist uses to conceive characters, because no novel is a mere copy of real life. Real life figures, when used as characters, undergo a transformation in the hands of a novelist because they must look authentic in the novel. They do in The Politician.

Readers usually discover new facets of life when reading the fiction of another culture and recognise familiar things when reading works of their own culture. But even our own culture may hold elements which may be in danger of being forgotten or which may not have been foregrounded in fiction enough. The treatment of many of such elements, in particular the chaos and disorder in the everyday life in small towns, and the relationship between caste and politics in the Hindi heartland before the grand success of the right-wing, make The Politician a welcome addition to the canon of Indian English fiction.

108,Green politics is beset by a fundamental paradox - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/aug/29/green-politics-is-beset-by-a-fundamental-paradox,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com,politics,"Andy Beckett is right to find some optimism in the record of the exceptional Green MP Caroline Lucas and the party’s growing number of councillors (The Greens are on the brink of power – is it more than a political blip?, 27 August). However, the crucial route to power for green politics lies in cooperation with non-Tory parties to gain enough public support for effective environmental policies.

The government promises much, but there is a dearth of concrete policies. The chancellor hasn’t even announced his green bonds initiative that is supposed to appear this summer. Our research has shown that were savers to be adequately incentivised, this could provide billions to finance the “green new deal”, if it was announced as a green recovery Isa, enabling usually older savers to fund green jobs.

Beckett’s other key point, that the climate crisis tends to leave voters feeling overwhelmed, paralysed or in denial, can be overcome if its solutions are seen as generating work everywhere. Equally, it must be seen as compensating poorer sections of society for the transitions to dearer, more sustainable food and energy supplies while retraining those whose jobs are threatened.

The French gilet jaunes were right to say that their main worry was about the end of the month, not the end of the world. The answer lies in making a credible case for how to fund such a transition. This will require green quantitative easing (QE), whereby government-created money is invested directly in public- and private-sector projects, as well as using savings and progressive taxation. In short we need a QuEST (QE, savings and taxation) to immediately finance the crucial green transformation.

Colin Hines

Convener, Green New Deal UK

The fundamental paradox in green politics is set out towards the end of Andy Beckett’s column, when he states that if all the main parties adopt green policies it would “make it harder for the Greens to differentiate themselves”. The crucial point is that “greenism” is not a policy; it is an analysis that sets out with brutal clarity the need to accept the ecological imperative and to change our way of living.

Thus a green campaign is essential, but a Green party actually undermines the acceptance of that imperative: the more successful it is, the more it draws supporters from the other parties and thus reduces the momentum and increases the pressures against it. It is necessary for the green imperative to be embedded in all the parties if we are to avoid catastrophe.

I am green, with a small G, because I am in possession of the dire facts, I have the science background to understand what those facts imply, and also I love nature for its own sake. However, I am also a moderate Tory (Macmillanite, I guess), though you may regard that as an oxymoron. And that is a problem: green politics is growing ever more inextricably entwined with leftwing politics, while simultaneously bedding with the increasingly authoritarian SNP.

For this reason, I would never vote for the Green party in its present incarnation, though I live as greenly as I can: I avoid waste, I recycle, I walk, and my garden is nature-friendly. Ideally, green issues ought to transcend party politics, because we all die of heatstroke at the same temperature.

However, the actor wants to set the record straight that he is not joining any party.

“I didn’t do this to get into politics, I just wanted to help people,” Sood tells us, adding, “When the whole movement of me helping people started in the first wave of the Covid pandemic (last year), even then these speculations started. I want to send across a message that politics is a great profession and there’s no harm in case someone wants to desire to be in that.”

The 48-year-old adds that it’s not mandatory that one has to be a politician to help people.

“Whatever I did in the past one and a half year, it also conveys that even if you’re not into politics, you can still help and motivate people. That’s a message. I want to tell people that don’t wait for an opportunity to help people, just do it now,” says the Dabangg (2010) and Simmba (2018) actor.

My hands are too full as an actor and the work I’m doing, connecting me with masses, touching those souls. I’m enjoying this space, but I don’t know what’s written in my fate tomorrow.”

Talking about the initiative he’s a part of now, Sood explains that the Delhi government approached him because of his work in the education sector.

“I supported close to 200 students in the first wave, and that has gone up to 20,000 students in the second phase of scholarships, which I started in my mother, Saroj Sood’s name. She was a professor, and always wanted me to do big in education as that can change lives,” he recalls."
110,"The Kerala Model That Is Really Broken Is Its Socio-Politics, Not Healthcare - Swarajya",https://swarajyamag.com/politics/the-kerala-model-that-is-really-broken-is-its-socio-politics-not-healthcare,Swarajya,https://swarajyamag.com,politics,"The 'Kerala model' has come under fire after the state started goofing up on Covid. Despite a fall elsewhere, in God’s Own Country Covid infection levels have refused to subside, and the state continues to account for over 69 per cent of daily new cases, and 56 per cent of all active cases in the country as on 30 August.

This is, however, not enough to debunk the Kerala model, which can loosely be said to be about high literacy and good quality healthcare services. These continue to be the state’s strong points, as is evident from the fatality rates in Covid. With 20,000-and-odd deaths from four million infections (compared to 438,000 deaths from 32.7 million cases all-India), Kerala’s fatality rate is less than 40 per cent of the national average of 1.3 per cent (from official reported statistics). This can hardly be called a failure of the Kerala education-cum-healthcare model.

But the underlying assumptions behind this Kerala model — that this high performance on social indicators is led by high state spending on public goods like education and health — is no longer true. As Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya noted in their book India’s Tryst With Destiny, the Kerala model is not any more driven by state spending, but by private investment and consumption. Far from being a communist paradise, its growth has been driven by entrepreneurship and private investment and spending in both education and health, apart from tourism. The state is claiming credit for things it did not do.

If one has to talk about any Kerala model that is broken, it has to begin here, and also in it dramatically shifting demographics. Rising economic and political challenges are threatening the Kerala model of growth and social stability like never before.

The economics that is falling apart: a large part of private spending over the last few decades has been financed by huge remittances from the Gulf region, where many Keralites are employed. But this boom has gone bust post-Covid, and the World Bank estimates that of the four million Malayalis working in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, 1.2 million have been repatriated back due to job losses and retrenchments. This means remittances are down too.

A Business Standard report, quoting the World Bank, had this to say this May. In Kerala, “an estimated 1.2 million migrant workers, out of more than four million who worked in the GCC countries and contributed 30 per cent of the state's income, returned in 2020 after the global pandemic left them jobless. Low-skilled workers were the hardest hit.”

Monthly remittances to families receiving them “fell on average by $267”. That’s a Rs 20,000 fall in family monthly incomes for those dependent on Gulf remittances. Since it is unlikely that most of these jobs will return post-pandemic, Kerala’s economic model of high dependency on remittances will prove to be a serious problem.

But it is in the political and social spheres that the 'secular' Kerala model appears most broken.

Till recently, Kerala had a two-front model, with one front (the United Democratic Front, or UDF) being a collection of communal organisations claiming to be secular; the other front, the Left Democratic Front (LDF), claimed to be secular by definition, since the Left supposedly believes in materialism, not religion, the opium of the people.

But underneath this apparent secularism, what we actually got was two mildly Hinduphobic fronts, one driven by actual minority communalists, and the other by a Hindu vote that did not see a future in a front where Muslim and Christian parties called all the shots.

But two things have happened over the last decade to undermine this cosy two-front system under which each front got to rule the state by turn. In this year’s assembly elections, the LDF created history by winning a second consecutive term. This has little to do with voter faith in this secular alternative. It reflects a failure of the communal UDF to win enough Hindu votes to retain power. The Hindu vote is gradually breaking off from this communal front, though it is still rudderless and without a party to claim its loyalties.

In the assembly elections, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 11.3 percent of the vote, which was enough to deny victory to the UDF, but not big enough to dent the LDF or make it a formal contender for power.

This churn in the Hindu vote is far from over, and in the coming elections, we will see new alliances to defeat the Left.

The reason why the Hindu vote is again beginning to waver from its traditional voting patterns is the dramatic shift in Muslim demography over the last decade.

According to the 2011 census, Muslims accounted for 26.56 per cent of Kerala’s population and Christians 18.38 per cent. This means the Hindu majority (54.73 per cent) is now under clear threat, and Christians, with lower birth rates, are beginning to fret about the growing Muslim demography. The actual Hindu population may be closer to the halfway mark, except for the undeclared status of crypto Christians who may have chosen to call themselves Hindu to avoid loss of quota benefits.

In 2015, recorded birth rates show that Muslim births had almost caught up with that of Hindus, even though Hindus are twice as large in the population. Reports of live births in that year showed that of the 5.16 lakh children born, 42.8 per cent were Hindu and 41.4 per cent Muslim, with Christians at 15.4 per cent.

This suggests that despite there being no appreciable difference in human development parameters or incomes of Muslims, their birth rate may be surging, with Hindu and Christian families punching far below their population weights. This goes against every assumption made in the past, that high poverty levels are the reason for high birth rates. With Muslims in Kerala, this does not seem to be the case.

This trend, if confirmed in subsequent years, will polarise the state in future elections. The biggest shift could happen among Hindus and Christians, and that fact that both these religious groups talk about 'love jihad' demonstrates that there is concern about demographic decline.

The Kerala socio-political map is being redrawn with the shift in favour of Muslim demographics, and this has been accompanied by the rise of more radical Islamist groups like the and its political arm, the Social Democratic Party of India. The emergence of this group will push relatively 'moderate' Muslim parties like the Indian Union Muslim League to make more demands from any front that it backs in future.

It is not the Kerala education-and-healthcare model that is broken, but its economic and socio-political model, that gave it some degree of political predictability since 1947, that has been stretched to breaking point. It is likely to be broken in this decade.

The Kerala healthcare model remains intact; what is broken is merely the excessive pride in that model, thanks to the LDF’s hubris."

This time, he allegedly made derogatory comments against women in politics.

In the video which went viral on social media, he can be seen calling women in politics ‘rakhail’ (mistress). He said, “The women you see in politics is or had been rakhail of at least one male politician. If she is not a mistress, she is relative of an influential political leader”.

He further alleged mistresses existed during Samajwadi Party rule. However, male politicians could not promote mistresses during Bahujan Samajwadi Party rule.

In the later part of the video, he can be seen making similar allegations on the women politicians in the ruling party too.

Sure, that may sound like a column for the dog days of late August, but I think our current humorlessness actually says quite a bit about the state of American politics.

It wasn't too long ago that Bob Dole, Morris K. Udall, Alan Simpson, Bob Strauss and Ted Kennedy brought a welcome levity to politics, as did presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

Humor can offer a respite.

“Gentlemen why do you not laugh?” Abraham Lincoln asked his cabinet during the Civil War. “With the fearful strain that is upon me day and night if I did not laugh, I should die.” He was the model; when accused of being two faced, Lincoln responded, “If I had two faces would I be wearing this one?”

Politics today are downright dour.

Mark Shields, who as a columnist, commentator and earlier a political strategist was unsurpassed for his keen humor as well as political insights, offers an explanation: “Contemporary politicians lack the sense of self or the self-confidence to use humor. Every issue is of gravity, and any use of humor might suggest not taking the issue being discussed seriously enough.”

The upshot, he says, is “our politics is more grim as a result of the absence of humor, less interesting, and our politicians are a lot more self-serious, even self-important.”

Dick Flavin is a legendary Boston humorist and former television commentator who has written speeches for prominent Democrats like Ted Kennedy. He traces much of this overbearing seriousness to Newt Gingrich Newton (Newt) Leroy GingrichMORE, the former Republican Speaker of the House: “He rose to prominence by preaching that politics is war and that the other side should be treated as enemies, to be destroyed at all costs. The loss of our sense of humor is collateral damage.”

Self-deprecating humor used to be an effective tool. “If you can make fun of yourself, it says 'I'm just like you,’” notes former Republican humor speech writer, Landon Parvin.

Eric Schnure, a Washington-based consultant who has written many humor speeches, mainly for Democratic politicians but also a few Republicans, agrees: “The goal no longer is to define yourself as witty and appeal to all while scoring a point. It's now solely to score the point.”

A reprise, familiar mainly to us old-timers is revealing; try to imagine any of this from today's politicians.

Self-deprecation was a staple of the Kennedys. I remember covering Ted Kennedy in the1970s when he was campaigning for Jay Rockefeller John (Jay) Davison RockefellerHumorless politics a sad sign of our times Bottom Line World Health Day: It's time to fight preventable disease MORE in West Virginia. The brother of the former president said he was shocked that a young man — Rockefeller — would run for high office trading on a famous name.

Before the 1960 presidential primaries, Joseph Kennedy's willingness to spend big money on his son's race was controversial. At one Gridiron dinner, JFK read a telegram supposedly from his father: “Don't buy one more vote than necessary. I'll be damned if I'm going to pay for a landslide.""

When criticized for soaring deficits, Reagan replied, “I am not worried about the deficit. It is big enough to take care of itself.""

Making light of your own party was a winner. Bob Dole once quipped that “Only a Republican would think that the best part of Viagra is the fact that you could make money off it.” Arizona’s Morris Udall, a Democrat, said he wanted to be buried in Chicago — so he could “remain active in politics.”

One of my favorite moments in years of interminable Washington press dinners was sitting next to Udall, a liberal Democrat, as he marveled at the timing of conservative Republican Alan Simpson.

The Wyoming Republican once noted that in “your country club, your church and business, about 15 percent of the people are screwballs, lightweights and boobs. You would not want those people unrepresented in Congress.”

My favorite story is the one Udall used to tell about the politician who was visiting an Indian reservation right before an election. If they voted for him, he promised a new hospital for the reservation: “Goomwah, Goomwah,” the tribe responded. Udall said the politician then added if they voted for him, they'd get a new school: “Goomwah, Goomwah” was the enthusiastic reply. As the self-satisfied politician was leaving by the horse corral, Udall said, the tribal chief cautioned him to be careful not to step in the goomwah.

116,Has the first-past-the-post system polarised Indian politics? - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/has-the-first-past-the-post-system-polarised-indian-politics/article36127365.ece,The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com,politics,"Politicising social divides and failings of the parliamentary system have led to this situation

India’s parliamentary democracy is going through a phase of intense confrontation between the dominant ruling party and a weakened but belligerent Opposition. Is this situation a consequence of the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system, where a party with the the highest votes gets the seat even if it doesn't win a majority? Suhas Palshikar and E. Sridharan address this question in a discussion moderated by Srinivasan Ramani. Edited excerpts:

Prof. Palshikar, you had written recently about the emergence of a second dominant party system with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) becoming the central pole of Indian politics ever since it came to power at the Centre in 2014. Even if the BJP has now lost ground, with its vote share reducing in various State elections, it did retain its highest average cumulative vote share for election cycles. That said, what similarities and dissimilarities do you see with the hegemonic period of the Congress of the 1950s and ’60s?

Suhas Palshikar: The similarity is in the vote share numbers garnered by the dominant party and in its capacity to fragment the Opposition. In terms of numbers, a dominant party gets a disproportionately larger share in seats in legislatures compared to its vote share. The other similarity is in its ability to remain dominant by fragmenting the Opposition and so we see the recent discussions on Opposition unity.

The dissimilarities are evident in the roots of the dominance and the journeys towards it. The Congress emerged as a dominant party as a result of its contribution to the freedom struggle; the roles that Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and others played then. It converted that legitimacy into electoral dominance. The BJP emerged in 2014 as electorally dominant and has since been trying to establish its hegemony. That is why I have argued that its hegemony is still in the making while it has become dominant electorally.

Dr. Sridharan, the hegemony enjoyed by the Congress in the 1950s and ’60s gave way to trends in Indian politics such as federalisation and regionalisation. So, even if we had the FPTP system, there was a certain degree of diversification that allowed for newer forces to emerge organically. Since 2019, the fact that the BJP has garnered a disproportionate seat share relative to its vote share has revived the critique of the FPTP. Your view?

E. Sridharan: The BJP’s dominance in both 2014 and 2019 was based on a plurality of votes (31% and 37%) converting into a majority of seats and is similar to the Congress’s dominance from 1952 to 1984 which was also based on vote share pluralities converting to seat majorities (sometimes two-thirds to three-fourths majority). The FPTP system tends to magnify the seat share of the party with the largest vote share, while parties receiving a lower vote share tend to get a much lower seat share. There are exceptions such as the Karnataka Assembly elections of 2008 and the Madhya Pradesh elections of 2018 where the party which got a slightly higher vote share got a lower seat share.

The BJP is today not as hegemonic as the Congress of the past. Forty-two of the 303 seats that it won in 2019 were in three States — Maharashtra, Punjab and Bihar — and were at least partially due to vote transfer from allies; seat shares have not reached two-thirds majority; and the party’s spread across States is less than the Congress’s in its heyday.

Also read | What is Proportional Representation?

As for the FPTP system, I would like to introduce Duverger’s law to your readers. [Maurice] Duverger, a French political scientist, argued that the FPTP system tends to bring about a two-party system at the constituency level. In countries like India, this translated into the establishment of a two-party system at the State level which happened between 1967 and 1989. Post-1990, this produced three kinds of bipolarity: Congress versus BJP in a number of States, Congress versus the Left in three States, and Congress versus regional parties in other States. This was an outcome of Duverger’s law operating at the State level.

At the national level, 2014 marked the end of a 25-year period of a coalition/minority government. And post-2014, there was the emergence of a second dominant party system. I don’t think that FPTP necessarily produces polarisation. If you look at the proportional representation (PR) system in Europe and elsewhere, where seats are allocated roughly in accordance with the vote share, that also produces distinct polarisations. Look at the 1978 Sri Lankan Constitution which instituted the PR system. Since then, there has been ethnic polarisation despite the small parties getting seat shares higher than what they would have received in a FPTP system. Similarly in Israel, which also enjoys a thoroughgoing PR system, there is severe polarisation in ethnic, religious and political terms.

Also Read Conference on democracy stresses on political reforms

The FPTP system can’t be blamed for polarisation. Polarisation is linked to the politicisation of certain social cleavages. These cleavages are sometimes dormant in society and can become active or can be activated through mobilisations. When certain social cleavages are activated, that is when they get magnified by the electoral system.

Prof. Palshikar, today there is little dialogue between the ruling party and the Opposition. What explains this stasis?

Suhas Palshikar: I agree with Dr. Sridharan that it is not FPTP that is creating polarisation. One of the general reasons for the adversarial relations between the ruling party and the Opposition is the failure in institutionalising the parliamentary system, which presupposes a certain negotiation, a spirit of give and take and continuous deliberation between the ruling party and the Opposition.

We have failed in generating an institutional pattern for this tendency. I would locate the beginning of this as the time around the Emergency period when the spirit of dialogue dissipated. Since then, the dialogue process has been up and down. If you come to the current moment, I think it is the distrust between the ruling party and the Opposition that has produced this stasis. The problem is not about the institutional mechanisms that we adopt; it is in the processes that we implement those mechanisms. Those process-related issues can be located in social and other cleavages and how they play out in competitive politics. It is the extreme competitive nature of our polity and the frustrations that come with the presence of a dominant party in the system besides the arrogance that stems from electoral dominance that leads to an inability to engage with the Opposition.

E. Sridharan: The confrontational situation in Parliament and other legislatures has heightened in the last couple of years. This is due to the sharpening of the ideological level in politics, which reflects the cleavages in the society, and to the suspicion that the fundamentals of the system are being sought to be changed.

The ruling BJP is not a similar hegemonic force as the Congress in the sense that it had in its manifesto issues such as the Citizenship Amendment Bill and the abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. In a way, the BJP has an agenda that is beyond the constitutional consensus that guides the policies of most political parties in India. Is this a reason for the current state of affairs too?

Suhas Palshikar: Just to supplement what Prof. Sridharan said, we witness today a new phase that is marked by a confrontation that is not merely one of political contestation in the ordinary sense of the term. Here is a party that wants to change the entire system fundamentally and other parties are still not sure how to respond to that. They instinctively oppose it but at the same time they understand that the difference is in the approach of the dominant party, that they have to adapt/adjust to that stance so that they garner enough votes in the next election. This confusion among the non-BJP parties produces not just distrust but lack of clarity on what ideological positions they must take during the ideological onslaught or the offensive of the BJP. The BJP has now changed the terms of how the political contestation will be held ideologically, and the inability of the non-BJP parties to appreciate and respond to this and to produce an alternative narrative has led to a frustration that is reflected in their various responses to the BJP.

E. Sridharan: There is a perception that the ruling party is pushing against the constitutional consensus, which is fairly strong in our system. There are about three and a half layers of protection to the basic structure of our Constitution. The government needs a two-thirds majority in both Houses subject to the presence of at least 50% of the House in attendance. The government has a clear but not a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha. It doesn’t have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. In order to make constitutional amendments, it must get the support of smaller parties, which it has been able to get so far.

Then, it has to go through judicial review — the courts have so far not pronounced on some of the controversial issues that have come up in the last few years.

Finally, for some articles on Centre-State relations, it has to pass them through half the State Assemblies.

There are ideological shifts going on and new social cleavages that have been activated that have changed the political landscape.

Can it be said that federal issues are emerging as the area of contestation with the BJP on the one side and regional parties on the other?

Suhas Palshikar: In principle, the flashpoint in the next five years or so could be the federal relations between the Centre and the States on fiscal or other administrative and political matters. The various State parties are still not sufficiently aware of this possibility and therefore they are busy buying peace with the ruling party at the Centre, rather than confronting it. I don’t see any direct flashpoint emerging politically between the State parties and the BJP immediately, though.

Also Read BJP seems to have pervaded every nook and corner: Ashwani Kumar

Also, the ability of the BJP or any Central government in the last three decades to directly transfer resources to local bodies in the States bypassing the State government besides controlling the administrations of the States has weakened the State parties’ ability to take on the Central government. Objectively, they are not in a position to do so and subjectively, they are not sure how to pitch the fight. Therefore, we have a fascinating period where there is all the making of a federal flashpoint, but at the same time, the actual flashpoints may be somewhere else in reality.

Do you see a mixture of postures — negotiation, confrontation and adjustment by various regional parties vis-à-vis the Centre? The Biju Janata Dal (BJD), YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) using one ploy, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) using another, and so on?

Suhas Palshikar: I would use the word ‘acquiescence’ to describe how the BJD, YSRCP and the TRS’s relations are with the Centre.

To bring the discussion back to the electoral system, is a FPTP system with a preference rule system to go along with it a better form of voting than the FPTP system?

E. Sridharan: The Australian electoral system is fairly similar to what you talk about, where the first choice party with the plurality vote share will receive second/third choices of the voter in a process of elimination from the bottom, till it reaches the 50% threshold to be declared the winner. I think such an alternative system should be assessed in terms of the ease of its use for the voters. It would not be easy to operate in India. Second, as regards the provision that a party must get 50% of the votes through preference voting, this would actually make it easier for the leading candidate to bridge the gap between, say, 40% to 50% as compared to someone else who gets 25% and could possibly contribute to the same kind of magnified majoritarianism that FPTP does in its own institutional way. So, it may not be that different.

Suhas Palshikar: To put an extra burden on the voter in the act of voting is unfair and that is why this is not to my liking. Second, the 50% mark, as Prof. Sridharan pointed out, is artificially achieved.

We need to go back to the drawing board on what is the real issue with FPTP, which is the disproportionate number of seats accrued by a party despite a lower vote share. However, if the political system is adequately competitive, that aspect of the FPTP system gets politically neutralised and parties tend to get a share of seats which is roughly commensurate to their vote share also.

The other issue with the FPTP is that the threshold is so high that newer parties cannot enter the fray. Therefore, I suggest that rather than the alternative you are talking about, one can talk about a system that will supplement FPTP — let’s say have 10% of the seats in the legislature which are included based on the parties’ vote shares. This will ensure an entry point for smaller/ newer parties and keep the political system more competitive.

The larger point is if we artificially try to make the political system fairer, the natural competitiveness gets distorted and that is why I would generally prefer FPTP, both on the grounds of voters’ convenience and a natural competitiveness being allowed in the system.

E. Sridharan: I think there is sufficient diversity at the societal level. There is the theory that in a socially diverse country, the party system will be diverse — it will not be limited to a two-party system. India seems to support the effective production of multiple parties at the national level even if the FPTP system limits the competition to a bipolar system in the States because these are a multiplicity of bipolarities (for example, BJP-Congress, BJP-regional party, etc.) and not the same bipolarity.

Having seized control of Afghanistan, the Taliban told women to stay at home, supposedly for their own safety. America and other countries advised their citizens not to go to Kabul airport because of the imminent threat of a terrorist attack. The Taliban warned that there would be “consequences” if American troops remained beyond the evacuation deadline of August 31st. Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan’s former president, turned up in the United Arab Emirates. A group of fighters in the Panjshir Valley continued to resist the new regime. See here and here.

The World Bank suspended funding to Afghanistan, in part over concerns that the Taliban would interfere with development projects aimed at women. The IMF has already halted payments to the country. America and other countries froze almost all of Afghanistan’s $9bn in foreign reserves. Experts warned of a looming economic crash.

Ismail Sabri Yaakob was sworn in as Malaysia’s prime minister following the resignation of the unpopular Muhyiddin Yassin. Mr Ismail Sabri comes from the same circle of politicians who backed the previous government, which mishandled the pandemic. He was picked by Malaysia’s king, who wants him to face a vote of confidence in parliament.

The ruling parties of Japan and Taiwan prepared to hold their first-ever security talks on August 27th to discuss the military threat from China. The talks are between parties and not governments because Japan and Taiwan do not have diplomatic relations.

In an unexpected move, China’s parliament delayed imposing a requirement that Hong Kong uphold an anti-sanctions law. The bill, passed in June, mandates the punishment of firms that comply with sanctions against Chinese companies or officials.

Joe Biden nominated Nicholas Burns to be his ambassador to China. Mr Burns was appointed to a role in the State Department during the presidency of George W. Bush and is a former American ambassador to NATO . Mr Biden also nominated Rahm Emanuel, a chief of staff under Barack Obama, as ambassador to Japan.

America’s Supreme Court overruled Mr Biden’s decision to allow asylum-seekers at the Mexican border into the United States while their cases are heard. Mr Biden had suspended an order from Donald Trump that directed the asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico. The court said the order must be reinstated, because Mr Biden’s action was probably “arbitrary and capricious”.

Kathy Hochul was sworn in as the governor of New York state, following the resignation of Andrew Cuomo amid claims of sexual harassment.

The House of Representatives passed a $3.5trn budget with a provision that avoids a filibuster when the spending plan is debated in the Senate. Before the vote the Democratic leadership in the House faced a mini-revolt from party moderates, who were placated with assurances that an infrastructure measure that has bipartisan support will come up for a vote before September 27th.

At least 20 people died when floods swept through rural areas in west Tennessee. Flooding also killed at least 20 people in Venezuela.

The left-wing government in Bolivia charged Jeanine Áñez, a former interim president, with “genocide”. The far-fetched charge refers to the deaths of 20 protesters, some of whom were supporters of the current government, during clashes with police in 2019. She has been in jail since April on charges of planning a coup against Evo Morales, her predecessor as president, and has been hospitalised recently for hypertension and trying to harm herself.

After calling a snap election Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, faced a double whammy of tightening polls and a barrage of criticism over a slow response to evacuating Canadian interpreters from Afghanistan. Polls suggest that Mr Trudeau’s Liberal Party will narrowly win the election on September 20th. But some are within the margin of error, and the Conservatives have criticised him for holding the vote while the country faces a fourth wave of covid-19. Inflation may also hurt his party.

An appeals court in Kenya upheld a decision by the High Court blocking a constitutional overhaul supported by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The scheme would have created dozens of new constituencies and several new posts, such as a prime minister. Many saw it as an effort by Mr Kenyatta to make it harder for his estranged deputy, William Ruto, to succeed him next year.

Hissène Habré, who ruled Chad from 1982 to 1990, died after contracting covid-19. He was serving a life sentence in Senegal for crimes against humanity. Thousands of people were executed, tortured or jailed under his regime. See here.

Tunisia’s president, Kais Saied, extended his suspension of parliament until further notice, raising concerns about the future of the Arab world’s only real democracy. Last month Mr Saied dismissed the prime minister and assumed executive authority, actions that his opponents called a coup. But the president, who was elected on a promise to clean up corruption, has widespread support.

He added that present discord can be resolved and the party will steer ahead.

Meanwhile, reacting to K Sudhakaran’s gesture at the press meet, Muraleedharan said that there is nothing wrong in showing the diary. He downplayed the act by saying that the gesture is part of Sudhakaran’s mannerism. Sudhakaran raised the diary to denote his objection over the remark that decisions were made without discussion, he said.

Muraleedharan further added that if he were in his place, the gesture would have been avoided. ""But it’s just part of Sudhakaran's mannerism and Congress need all such mannerisms in the party,"" he said.

Similarly, Muraleedharan hinted on how discontent of among some members will be resolved. “Let youngsters come to the party. At the same time, senior leaders should be also considered. The view of Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala will be given due consideration. It is also the responsibility of youngsters not sent elders to old age homes,” he said."

The shadow business secretary said it was important to give answers to the “grievances” in people’s lives, while also challenging populism when it is “wrong”.

Speaking at the Edinburgh international book festival, the former Labour leader said Boris Johnson’s attempt to have a “political culture war” left him on the “wrong side of the argument” over England football players taking the knee.

Miliband told a virtual event on Saturday that “the rise of populism is also testimony to the failure of mainstream politics”, adding that it needed to address the “deep discontent” that some people feel.

“I always think about this advert [Donald] Trump did two days before the 2016 election, which was all about ‘you’ve lost your jobs, the global elite have failed you’ and so on,” he said.

“Some part of what he was saying was right and unless you answer that deep discontent, I think explaining better why mainstream politics is really quite good is never going to get you anywhere.”

Miliband added: “Somebody once said, I think, ‘Don’t love Trump, but love Trump voters’ … I think understanding people’s pain is really important in this. The soil in which populism grows, this nasty populism grows, is discontent and therefore you’ve got to understand people’s pain. I think you do also have to sort of call them out.”

He said he was “struck” by what happened earlier this year over Johnson “refusing to condemn” those who booed England players taking the knee.

Miliband claimed the England manager, Gareth Southgate, had indirectly “shamed” the prime minister with his comments explaining what the players were protesting about and why it was a “patriotic thing to do”.

He added: “I think that episode is really interesting for the way in which Johnson, and the kind of attempt to have a political cultural war by him, really ended up on the wrong side of the argument.”

Summarising his own argument, Miliband said: “One, understand the pain that gives populism the ability to grow and succeed. And secondly, you’ve got to call it out and you’ve got to be strong.”

He added: “When it’s wrong you’ve got to call it out.”"

Addressing the mediapersons here, Ramakrishnan said, ""We have been suspecting since the beginning that the Centre is playing politics over the state's capital issue. This was proved in a recent Parliament session when responding to the petrol price hike in the respective states, the Centre mentioned Visakhapatnam as Andhra Pradesh capital. However, they changed Visakhapatnam as Reference City, but this shows that BJP and YSRCP are hand in glove.""



The central government is primarily responsible for rising petrol and diesel prices in the country, he said. At the same time, the Andhra Pradesh government has also increased taxes on petrol and diesel, Ramakrishnan said. ""The neighbouring states are reducing prices, but Jagan Mohan Reddy government is not taking any such initiatives. We request the state govt to reduce the burden on the people of the state,"" he said.

He slammed the BJP-led Central government and YSRCP for privatizing public assets.

The CPI Secretary said, ""On one side, the state government is opposing the privatization of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), on the other hand, the state is selling its 10 per cent stake in Gangavaram Port in Visakhapatnam."" (ANI)

Beyond ""experience tourism"" and light entertainment, temporary architecture is a fertile ground for testing ideas, examining places, popularizing new concepts and technologies. Taking a wide array of forms, from disaster relief projects and utilitarian structures to design experiments, architectural statements and playful installations, transient structures showcase alternative visions for the built environment, opening up new possibilities and questioning established norms. As temporary architecture now seems at odds with sustainability imperatives, the following discusses the value of temporary architecture as a vehicle of experimentation, advancing design and engaging communities.

The allure of the temporary and the ephemeral can be found throughout the history of architecture, but it was perhaps The Great Exhibition of 1851 and its Chrystal Palace that crystalized the idea that modernity can be expressed in temporary structures. In the 70s, the metabolists further challenged the concept of permanence that seemed to define architecture, while the 21st century saw the proliferation of international exhibition, design festivals and a whole array of events that brought a new wave of temporary designs, which seem to be developing into an emergent professional field.

The limited lifespan of this kind of intervention becomes an alibi for highly speculative projects. Freed from conventions, certain interventions open up meaningful conversations for the future of architecture and urban planning. In 2016, MVRDV created the Stairs of Kriterion installation, expanding the public space on the roof of a prominent building in Rotterdam. The temporary intervention was a compelling illustration for new city development and catalyzed a wave of acknowledgement of this untapped spatial potential. Building on this temporary project, MVRDV has recently produced a catalogue of ideas to make use of Rotterdam's empty flat roofs.

In some instances, temporary structures are transient replacements for other venues. The very specific purpose and time frame bring into focus the idea of design for disassembly and adaptive reuse. Most recently, while the 19th century Grand Palais in Paris is undergoing renovation, a temporary structure dubbed Grand Palais Éphémère will take its place in hosting Paris' major art events. Similarly, the Shengli Market is a temporary market designed by Luo Studio in China to serve the community while the old one was being renovated. Both projects can be dismantled, recycled, or reused for other constructions.

Exploring New Technologies

Freed of the rigours of commercial architecture and building regulations, temporary architecture is the perfect opportunity for showcasing new technology and construction methods. In this sense, the Institute for Computational Design (ICD) and the Institute of Building Structures and Structural Design (ITKE) have been creating a series of experimental pavilions to develop applications for the field of architecture. Pushing the boundaries of engineering and construction, the structures illustrate the potential of new technologies before deploying them on a larger scale.

A Vehicle of Urban Interventions

A potential precursor to conventional development processes, temporary interventions in the urban environment represent an adaptable framework for testing the validity of urban renewal strategies, helping define the potential to regenerate neglected spaces, consolidate the social infrastructure of a city, or improve public perception of various sites. For Manifesta 14, Carlo Ratti Associati designed a series of temporary urban interventions exploring different ways of reclaiming public space as part of a framework for participatory urbanism. Citizens will give feedback, highlighting which interventions should be preserved and consolidated.

The Value of Play

Oftentimes, rule-breaking structures are meant to engage communities, enriching the experience of the public realm. The Berlin-based design studio Plastique Fantastique operates in the field of temporary architecture, creating performative urban settings. Its pneumatic structures create alternative spaces, provide the framework for temporary activities, acknowledging the value of experience and play. Building on the work of 1960s utopian group Haus-Rucker-Co, the creations of Plastique Fantastique play with boundaries and the scenes of daily life.

Intended as temporary projects, structures like the Eiffel Tower or London Eye became a fixture of public space, while projects like Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion or the Smithson's House of the Future illustrated compelling visions of a new architecture. These examples, along with their contemporary counterparts, show the potential lasting impact of temporary architecture."

'Candyman' Towers Over Box Office With Impressive $22 Million Debut

""Candyman"" was summoned to the top of domestic box office charts, collecting an impressive $22.37 million from 3,569 theaters in its first three days of release. The R-rated slasher film, written by Jordan Peele and directed by ""Captain Marvel 2"" filmmaker Nia DaCosta, surpassed industry expectations despite fears the delta variant would keep people from going to the movies. Though multiplexes have struggled to sustain momentum as COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Hollywood has witnessed that new films available only in theaters (such as ""Candyman"" and last weekend's champ ""Free Guy"") have been seeing ticket sales hold steady compared to tentpoles being offered simultaneously on streaming services (like ""The Suicide Squad"" and Hugh Jackman's ""Reminiscence"" ).

Actor Ed Asner, star of 'Mary Tyler Moore,' 'Lou Grant' dies at age 91 - family

Ed Asner, who played a gruff newsman for laughs and for drama in the classic TV series ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and its spinoff ""Lou Grant"" in the 1970s and 1980s and was honored with seven Emmy Awards, died on Sunday at age 91, his family said. Asner, whose diverse credits also included a key voice role in the acclaimed 2009 animated film ""Up,"" died at his home surrounded by his family, his publicist told media outlets.

202,Copyright case: Zee Entertainment to postpone launch of ‘Baal Shiv’ TV series till Sept 15 - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/copyright-case-zee-entertainment-to-postpone-launch-of-baal-shiv-series-7474126/,The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com,entertainment,"Broadcaster Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd told the Bombay High Court Friday that it will not launch the television series ‘Baal Shiv – Mahadev ki Andekhi Gaatha’ till September 15 in the wake of a copyright infringement suit filed against it by writer and mythologist Chotenlal Saini.

A single judge bench of Justice Gautam S Patel was hearing the interim plea filed by Saini against Zee Entertainment in connection with the television series which was scheduled to start airing from August 31. Saini had sought an injunction order to restrain the broadcaster from releasing the TV serial, saying that he was the first to conceptualise the idea of ‘Baal Shiv’ as a serial.

“On specific instructions, the Zee Entertainment agrees that without prejudice to its rights and contentions, defendants will reschedule the launch of their TV show until September 15. Statement noted and accepted. The defendants will be entitled to continue with promos and teasers with rescheduled date with rival contentions not being affected. Whether or not the defendant to telecast the show will depend on the order that will be passed on interim application,” the HC order read.

The court has allowed Zee Entertainment to continue airing promos and teasers of the series that expressly mention its rescheduled launch date.

Saini said he had communicated his idea to representatives of the defendant company, who then lifted the detailed story that was narrated for producing the series. After Zee Entertainment showed no interest in producing the serial despite repeated narrations, he approached other channels and also registered the title under the Trademarks Act.

Later, on finding that Zee Entertainment had allegedly “breached confidentiality” when the channel announced the release of the serial, Saini approached the high court.

He alleged that the Zee series, with a “nearly identical name” has “substantial reproduction and adaptation of his original literary work” and, therefore, he deserved relief from the court.

Representing the broadcaster, senior advocate Virag Tulzapurkar and advocate Hiren Kamod denied the allegations and opposed Saini’s interim plea. Tulzapurkar submitted that Saini could not have concluded that his entire work has been plagiarised based on a 40-50 second teaser and added that the concept of ‘Baal Shiv’ was not novel as claimed but has previously been used in various films and TV shows, one of which the defendants had been a part of.

Tulzapurkar sought rejection of Saini’s plea saying that episodes to be aired over a span of three months have been readied, whereas Saini’s concept was not even communicated.

On behalf of Saini, senior counsels Venkatesh Dhond and Birendra Saraf said that during his meetings with Zee Entertainment, the firm had encouraged Saini’s idea and based on that he had started to conceptualise it.

Accepting Dhond’s request, the court said Saini deserved an opportunity to view the show and make his submissions during the next hearing. It asked Zee Entertainment to screen the first 10 episodes of the serial for Saini and his advocate by September 1 on premises indicated by the defendant.

The HC added that Saini must not disclose any information on the content that will be shown to him. “It goes without saying that the plaintiff must not record or videotape the episodes,” the judge said.

Seeking an affidavit in response from Zee Entertainment by September 4 and a rejoinder by Saini by September 8, the high court posted the matter for further hearing on September 15."

'Candyman' Towers Over Box Office With Impressive $22 Million Debut

""Candyman"" was summoned to the top of domestic box office charts, collecting an impressive $22.37 million from 3,569 theaters in its first three days of release. The R-rated slasher film, written by Jordan Peele and directed by ""Captain Marvel 2"" filmmaker Nia DaCosta, surpassed industry expectations despite fears the delta variant would keep people from going to the movies. Though multiplexes have struggled to sustain momentum as COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Hollywood has witnessed that new films available only in theaters (such as ""Candyman"" and last weekend's champ ""Free Guy"") have been seeing ticket sales hold steady compared to tentpoles being offered simultaneously on streaming services (like ""The Suicide Squad"" and Hugh Jackman's ""Reminiscence"" ).

China cracks down on 'chaotic' celebrity fan culture after scandals

China cracked down on what it described as a ""chaotic"" celebrity fan culture on Friday, barring platforms from publishing popularity lists and regulating the sale of fan merchandise after a series of controversies involving artists. The country's top internet watchdog said it would take action against the dissemination of ""harmful information"" in celebrity fan groups and close down discussion channels that spread celebrity scandals or ""provoke trouble"".

Actor Ed Asner, star of 'Mary Tyler Moore,' 'Lou Grant' dies at age 91 - family

Ed Asner, who played a gruff newsman for laughs and for drama in the classic TV series ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and its spinoff ""Lou Grant"" in the 1970s and 1980s and was honored with seven Emmy Awards, died on Sunday at age 91, his family said. Asner, whose diverse credits also included a key voice role in the acclaimed 2009 animated film ""Up,"" died at his home surrounded by his family, his publicist told media outlets.

206,"China's Crackdown On Entertainment Industry To Curb 'Irrational Idol Worship', Bans Online Celebrity Rankings And Regulates Fan Merchandise Sale - Swarajya",https://swarajyamag.com/news-brief/china-crackdowns-on-entertainment-industry-to-curb-irrational-idol-worship-bans-online-celebrity-rankings-and-regulates-fan-merchandise-sale,Swarajya,https://swarajyamag.com,entertainment,"China's cyberspace regulator on Friday (Aug 27) notified 10 measures that it says is aimed at combating sick parts of ""fan circle"" culture in the entertainment industry, tackling irrational displays by devoted fans blindly idolising celebrities, curbing excessive money spend on their ""idols,"" and outlaw the culture of cyberbullying and illegal fundraising widely prevalent in online fan clubs, Global Times reported.

The 10 measures unveiled by Cyberspace Administration of China include cancelling all ranking lists of entertainers, mandating that all online fan communities need to be authorised by agencies associated with the celebrity, regulating the sale of fan merchandise and punishing platforms that fail to quickly delete verbal attacks among fans of different idols.

The internet regulator also ordered local authorities should monitor celebrity culture online to maintain “political and ideological safety in the cyberspace as well as creating a clean internet”.

Following the directive from the regulator, local social media giant Weibo announced on Saturday (Aug 28) it has screened all super topics and lists, and closed 2,558 star-related super topics amid the country's fierce campaign to rectify fanquan chaos.

Weibo has been deleting verbal abuse posts and publishing information of account suspensions weekly since June to tackle verbal abuse and rumors concerning fan circles.

Xigua Video announced on Saturday(Aug 28) that it had removed 3,342 videos and 174,654 comments related to juveniles raising money to support their favorite stars, the improper behavior of star chasers and verbal attacks by different stars' fans. The platform said that 26,199 related accounts had been closed.

In a related move viewed as an attempt to cleanse the industry of bad influences, actress Zheng Shuang was fined 299 million yuan (US$46.1 million) for tax evasion

Local tax authorities charged Zheng of not disclosing 191 million yuan (US$29.5 million) in salary between 2019-2020, resulting in a tax evasion of 48 million yuan (US$7.4 million) and a further 26.5 million yuan (US$4.1 million) in underpaid taxes.

Another celebrity, Chinese-Canadian pop star Kris Wu, has been accused of by multiple women of date rape. He was charged with rape on August 16."

The company has 13 films in the pipeline across genres.

“The pandemic has given everyone time to develop scripts and we’ve realized the biggest hero we can bring to a film is a good script,"" said managing director Jackky Bhagnani who took over from father Vashu, veteran Hindi film producer, in 2018. In the time that Jackky has taken over the reins, the company has backed films such as Saif Ali Khan’s comedy drama Jawaani Jaaneman released in January 2020 and Varun Dhawan-starrer Coolie No.1 that premiered on Amazon Prime Video last December.

The big impact of the pandemic, Bhagnani said, is that going forward, film-makers and studios will be very clear on films that are made for a theatrical release and require the costs attached and the ones that would work better as direct-to-digital releases. “While shooting for Bellbottom late last year, we thought things would be completely normal by the time we are ready for release this year,"" Bhagnani said, admitting that with no night shows, states such as Maharashtra still shut and 50% seating occupancies, the film business is only running at 17-18% of normal times. “We’re not looking at (box office) numbers right now but are happy to have paved the way for more films to arrive in cinemas,"" he said.

Besides working on a slate of web originals that will soon be announced, Bhagnani is dabbling with music production through a label called Jjust Music that has just brought out an independent single called Vande Mataram featuring Tiger Shroff. “Our focus is independent music for now, and though we’re a startup that needs to scale up, we’re targeting 20-30 singles each year,"" he said.

208,Pacers Sports & Entertainment Launches Effort to Expand Supplier Diversity - Pacers.com,https://www.nba.com/pacers/news/pacers-sports-entertainment-launches-effort-expand-supplier-diversity,Pacers.com,https://www.nba.com,entertainment,"INDIANAPOLIS - Diverse business owners now have a streamlined way to engage with Pacers Sports & Entertainment through a new supplier diversity portal that is part of the company’s push to create opportunities for traditionally disenfranchised vendors.

Minority-, women-, LGBTQIA+-, Veteran-, and Disability-owned businesses, known as XBEs, can register to learn about opportunities to contract with PS&E, stay up to date about vendor fairs and other programs, and engage with the organization’s procurement staff specifically focused on increasing supplier diversity. The effort is one of the strategic objectives laid out by PS&E’s Inclusive Excellence Action Committee (IEAC) last July, an employee-led working group that guides the company’s DEI initiatives, and aligns to the five-pillar Social Justice Agenda it established.

""Diversifying our vendor partnerships makes our company stronger and represents important investments in the businesses that support neighborhoods across our city and state,"" said Rick Fuson, PS&E President and Chief Operating Officer. ""This new portal gives us a more intentional way to ensure we are increasing our supplier diversity, a great step in our continual process of becoming a more equitable organization.""

The goal of developing a world-class supplier diversity program was one of the very first identified by the IEAC, which has included the hiring of purchasing staff with an expertise in implementing such programs and new policies to ensure more diverse vendor participation across the organization. Daune Conwell, PS&E's Senior Procurement Director, was brought in to lead the effort and help XBEs navigate how to do business with the company. She is the first in this newly-created role.

""For many XBEs, the process of competing for work with a company like PS&E can be daunting and difficult to navigate,"" said Conwell. ""Meeting meaningful supplier diversity goals requires cultivating relationships and communicating continually, and this new tool gives us a more effective way to engage with a broader group of business owners.""

In addition to supplier diversity, other PS&E objectives include committing more than half of all PS&E charitable resources to organizations striving for social justice and delivering diversity, equity, and inclusion training for all employees.

“Extremely grateful to receive the Golden Visa for the UAE. Truly honored and humbled. Looking forward to a memorable association with this beautiful nation!! (sic),” tweeted Tovino.

It makes Tovino Thomas the third Malayalam actor to receive the golden visa after Mammootty and Mohanlal. The two stalwarts of Malayalam cinema received the golden visa last week during their trip to Dubai. Before them, Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt and Suniel Shetty were also provided with the golden visa.

His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, had in November last year approved the issuance of a 10-year golden visa for professionals in a bid to keep the “talented people and great minds” in the Gulf country and help in nation-building.

On the work front, Tovino Thomas is currently waiting for the release of Minnal Murali. The superhero film was supposed to be released in cinemas earlier this year. However, the second wave of coronavirus upended its release plans. The buzz is that the filmmakers have struck a deal with Netflix to give it a straight-to-streaming release. However, an official word on the same is awaited."

A resident of Sonepat in Haryana, Sumit lost his left leg below the knee after he was involved in a motorbike accident in 2015. In the finals, he sent the spear to 68.55m in his fifth attempt, which was the best of the day by quite a distance and a new world record. His win got India its second gold at the Paralympics after shooter Avani Lekhara.

Many Bollywood and TV celebrities took to social media to congratulate these young athletes. Congratulating both the gold winners, Sidharth Shukla tweeted, “Indians making us proud over and over again… a World Record in addition to the #Gold in #Paralympics … congratulations #SumitAntil and #AvaniLekhara.”

Akshay Kumar also shared a photo of Sumit and wrote, “Yet another #Gold for India! Heartiest congratulations #SumitAntil on the record-breaking throw 🙌🏻 What a brilliant performance. We are so proud of you. #Paralympics #Tokyo2020.”

A sports enthusiast himself, Abhishek Bachchan shared on Twitter, “A force to reckon with! Congratulations, #SumitAntil, for winning a #gold medal and taking #TokyoParalympics by storm with a world record in #JavelinThrow.”

213,Armaan Kohli: Everything you need to know about the actor - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/armaan-kohli-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-actor-7476260/,The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com,entertainment,"Armaan Kohli has been arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau in connection with a drugs case. The actor, who has remained away from limelight for years now, suddenly finds himself in news. The actor will be reportedly presented before a city court later in the day. But for all of you, who don’t remember the ’90s actor, let’s rewind and refresh your memory.

Who is Armaan Kohli?

Armaan Kohli is an actor and son of director Rajkumar Kohli. Armaan Kohli appeared as a child artiste in two films directed by his father: Badle Ki Aag (1982) and Raaj Tilak (1984). Armaan made his debut as a leading actor in his father’s 1992 film Virodhi. Reportedly, he was supposed to star in Deewana, which eventually went to Shah Rukh Khan. He was also set to star in Dilwale Dulhani Le Jayenge, but the role was finally played by Parmeet Sethi.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Armaan Kohli (@armaankohliofficial)

Armaan’s other ’90s releases, including Dushman Zamana (1992), Anaam (1993) and Aulad Ke Dushman, failed at the box office. After a four-year-long break, he returned with his father’s directorial– Qahar– alongside Sunny Deol and Suniel Shetty, but the film did nothing for his career.

Armaan took another hiatus– this time for five years– and made a comeback with multi-starrer Jaani Dushman: Ek Anokhi Kahani which also failed to do well.

Armaan Kohli’s claim to fame

After a failed Bollywood career, Armaan Kohli found recognition on television when he starred on reality TV show Bigg Boss season seven in 2013. On the Salman Khan-hosted show, Armaan came to be known for his poor temper, several fights with co-contestants and close relationship with actor Tanishaa Mukerji. Armaan finished as a finalist. In fact, during the show itself, Kohli was arrested for alleged physical abuse with his co-participant, Sofia Hayat. He was released on bail next day.

215,Entertainment industry furious over continued delays in reopening sector - Irish Examiner,https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40369466.html,Irish Examiner,https://www.irishexaminer.com,entertainment,"Representatives of the entertainment industry have expressed fresh anger and frustration with Government over continued delays to the reopening of the sector.

Following a meeting with Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, and Arts Minister Catherine Martin, the Entertainment Industry Alliance (EIA) hit out at what they called the “lack of urgency” from the Government in terms of timelines.

The representatives said despite specifically writing to Government in advance of the meeting, ""highlighting our sectors‘ expectations, and requesting a confirmed reopening date for full capacity events, and a strategy to achieve the same — the Government failed to provide either"".

Speaking outside Government Buildings after the meeting, Ms Martin moved to assuage some of that anger and frustration.

She said she remained optimistic that a re-opening in early September is possible for the sector.

“What I was looking for is an early September phased return for live music and events and I remain optimistic about that before we go into this meeting,” she told reporters.

“The industry have always been clear that dates are needed. And that's what will be provided tomorrow. Clarity will be provided,” she added.

Confirming the Irish Examiner story on Monday morning, she said the way to allow indoor sports and other organised activities is through the use of the digital Covid certificate.

Dance and drama for children

She said she hoped to see indoor dance, drama and arts for children return during September also.

During the meeting, the EIA pleaded with the Government that it stop ""compounding the hardship suffered by the sector for 537 days"" by ensuring that an early September safe reopening date is implemented for those fully vaccinated to attend full capacity indoor and outdoor events.

The EIA said: ""Events must be viable with food and beverage sales a key source of income for our events, which are not funded by the taxpayer.

They also called for business and employee supports to remain in place and extended until June 2022, to help allow the sector to recover.

'Total lack of urgency'

“We continue to be disappointed and frustrated at the total lack of urgency on the part of Government for the reopening of the event industry, which represents 35,000 people and is worth €3.5bn to the Irish economy.

""This is despite being the only sector mandated to remain closed for nearly 18 months, far beyond any other industry or sector within Ireland,” they said.

On RTÉ Radio, Denis Desmond, managing director of MCD, said the entertainment sector needed to fully reopen to full capacity events to allow for the return of theatres, large weddings and concerts.

Mr Desmond said concerts and pantomines should now be permitted to go ahead for those who are fully vaccinated. He said: ""It's time to open up and live with the new normal.""

He said it was now a crucial stage for the Electric Picnic festival and a final call on whether it can go ahead needs to be made today.

He welcomed the news the Cabinet is meeting and considering a full return of public transport, among other issues."

The company closed the offerings including Yahoo News, Yahoo Cricket, Finance, Entertainment and MAKERS India from Thursday. These websites will no longer be accessible in India. American technology firm Verizon Media bought Yahoo in 2017.

Explaining the reason behind ceasing its publication in the country, the popular media company mentioned, “The new FDI regulations for digital media limit foreign ownership of media companies that operate and publish digital content in India in the ‘News and Current Affairs’ space, impacting our products Yahoo Cricket, Finance, News, Entertainment, and MAKERS India.""

Starting from October 15, 2021, the digital news media should comply with the 26 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) policy in India. In November 2020, Union ministry of information and broadcasting said that the companies, which have more than 26 per cent FDI, will be bound to seek government approval and also bring foreign shareholding down to 26 per cent by the next one year.

“We did not come to this decision lightly. However, Yahoo India has been impacted by changes to regulatory laws in India that now limit the foreign ownership of media companies that operate and publish digital content in India,"" the company said in a message posted on a website.

However, this will not impact their Yahoo Mail account users and their email ids. “There will be no impact on your Yahoo Mail account from this development. Your email ID will remain unchanged,"" the company said. “Yahoo Mail will continue to operate in India as normal. Click https://in.mail.yahoo.com to access your Yahoo Mail account,"" it added.

Reiterating it, Verizon-owned media group said,"" Yahoo Mail is not covered by FDI regulations for digital media and is therefore not impacted by this change..""

On resuming operation again in India in future, the media house said, “We’ve had a long association with India, and remain open to opportunities that connect us to users here.""

Wells Fargo Securities' Chris Harvey recently cut software to underweight from neutral and declared it a crowded trade. He based the decision on technicals and earnings fundamentals and high valuations.

""From a valuation point of view, you're paying about a 75% premium to the market for software and that's too rich,"" the firm's head of equity strategy told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Friday.

The Dow Jones US Software Index is up 28% over the last five months.

""It is a work from home play,"" said Harvey. ""We just don't think there's a whole lot of opportunity in the short term.""

He finds the opposite is true for media and entertainment.

""When we downgraded software, we did upgrade media and entertainment,"" said Harvey. ""If we look at the media and entertainment space, you're seeing better upward revisions, better growth opportunities. But you're only paying a 15% premium.""

He boosted his media and entertainment group rating to overweight from neutral and listed it as his top market play.

""There's a lot of money to be spent. There's still a lot of pent-up demand,"" he said. ""The media and entertainment space offers a much better opportunity to capitalize on that reopening play.

Not only does he see strong fundamentals and improving sentiment, Harvey contends advertising is making a comeback in the diverse group, which includes everything from cable companies and big cap tech names.

The S&P 500 Media & Entertainment Index is up 4% over the last month and 34% so far this year."

The company will utilise the funds towards expanding its product portfolio, increasing its marketing efforts, and building out its team.

Launched in 2018, Elevar has two core product categories - athletic performance footwear and cricket bats. Their team of designers, engineers and partners seek to deliver cutting-edge designs utilizing the latest research from biophysics and sport.

“We are thrilled to have and Dream Capital partner with us,” said Kunal Joshi, Co-founder, Elevar. “This gives us the platform to take our product portfolio to the next level, enabling us to build a millennial-first sports brand that addresses our customer’s performance requirements as well as their modern design sensibilities.”

Co-founders, Kunal Joshi and Aayush Taapuriah are friends who met in 2007 at Cornell University. They took divergent paths after college gaining rich experience across consulting, banking, investing and startups in both the US and India. 10 years on, Joshi decided to quit his private equity job at Temasek Holdings and Taapuriah decided to return to India after finishing his MBA at Wharton, so that they could finally pursue their dream of building India’s first iconic sports brand.

The firm said it is driven by the belief that customers deserve the best possible sporting experiences at affordable price points. It is prioritising sourcing premium materials and utilize only the finest technologies for products across its portfolio.

“Cutting-edge materials and technology in sporting goods have always been priced out of reach for several Indians,” said Aayush Tapuriah, co-founder, Elevar. “Our direct-to-consumer business model enables us to offer customers these innovative technologies at an extremely attractive price point.”

Their flagship shoe - Arc Racer - is a versatile sneaker that is rich in features and high on design. At the heart of the shoe is Elevar’s proprietary sole unit, Rydefoam. Made from E-TPU, one of the world’s most innovative foam technologies, it gives the user a running experience that combines pillow-like softness with spring-like responsiveness. The firm said shoe is made affordable at one-third the price of comparable shoes from international brands.

Elevar’s unique line of cricket bats are engineered to offer an enhanced batting experience. Featuring the brand’s trademark ergonomic handle and sophisticated grip technology, these new-age bats enable superior power and control in each stroke. Aesthetically edgy, the firm said the bats are designed specifically to capture the minds of young cricketers.

“Aayush (Tapuriah) and Kunal's (Joshi) passion for building an India-first sports brand was infectious,” said Vani Kola, managing director, “Their understanding of the market, commitment to product innovation & customer experience stood out for us. We are proud to be an early partner in their vision to build a disruptive sports company from India.”

The sports footwear market in India alone is about $3.5 billion growing at about 15-20 per cent per annum. While there is still a large unorganized section of this market - rising incomes, changing consumer tastes and e-commerce penetration are all leading to the organized sector gaining more market share each year. Despite the sector featuring several established global and Indian brands, Elevar said that their disruptive product and marketing strategy will prove to be a winning combination allowing them to scale rapidly.

“Elevar's products speak for themselves in terms of their appeal, design and quality,"" said Dev Bajaj, managing director, Dream Capital. “We look forward to partnering with the team to develop India’s leading sports lifestyle brand.”"

The events at the Olympics are over; the Paralympics are going on. Now that such a momentum has been built up…sports has begun to be discussed in every family…do tell me…should this momentum be allowed to subside, to halt now? No…not at all. At home or elsewhere, in villages or cities, our playgrounds must be filled up. Let all play — let all bloom,” the PM said.Referring to India’s best ever performance in Olympics recently including ending the long wait for a medal in hockey, Modi said, “Wherever Major Dhyan Chand ji’s soul must be at the moment, it must be feeling overjoyed…since it was Dhyan Chand ji’s hockey that brought glory to Indian hockey in the whole world. And four decades later, almost after 41 years, the youth of India, her sons and daughters, once again infused vitality in our hockey.”The PM located his theme of sports promotion in what he called the striving among the youth for excellence. “When we cast a keen glance at the young generation, we notice sweeping change there. The mind of the youth has undergone a transformation. And today’s young minds, shunning obsolete, age old methods and patterns, want to do something new altogether; something different. Today’s young mind does not want to tread ready-made beaten paths; it wants to carve out newer paths,” the PM said.He further added, “The youth wants to step on unknown territory, new destinations, new goals, new roads, new aspirations. And once a young person decides in their mind, no stone is left unturned in the pursuit…persevering day and night.”Modi said today, the startup culture is expanding even to smaller cities, which, he said, heralds a bright future.“Just a few days ago, toys in our country were being discussed. Within no time, when this caught the attention of our youth, they too resolutely decided to work towards positioning Indian toys in the world with a distinct identity,” Modi said and added, “Generally, what had crept into our fabric was acceptance of mediocrity…”It happens”, “It’s okay — this will do”! But now I’m noticing my country’s young minds focusing on excellence. They want to do the best, using the best methods. This too will emerge as a major force for the nation.”Modi said when India opened her space sector, within no time the young generation lapped up the opportunity."

India is fortunate, Naidu said, to have the world's largest youth population apart from a vast pool of talented and aspirational sportspersons.

Therefore, there is no reason why the country cannot make a mark on the world stage in the field of sports, he felt.

""We need to develop a serious sporting culture right from school days to ensure satisfactory results on a sustained basis in this highly competitive field,"" the vice president said.

In a Facebook post to mark the National Sports Day, Naidu said India has no dearth of talent in any field. What is required is the early identification of this talent and proper grooming and encouragement.

""In the absence of an enabling ecosystem, many of our stars tend to fade into oblivion without realising their full potential. We end up losing full many a gem of purest ray serene to obscurity due to lack of proper grooming and support,"" the vice president lamented.

This year's National Sports Day assumes special significance on two counts—the all-time highest medal tally at the just concluded Tokyo Olympics and the renaming of the Khel Ratna Award after the legendary hockey player Major Dhyan Chand, he said.

""Both these developments mark an important milestone in the journey of Indian sports. While our athletes scripted history with their performance at the Tokyo Olympics and gave wings to the hopes of over a billion Indians, the renaming of the highest sporting award after Dhyan Chand is a fitting tribute to one of the greatest sensations in the history of Indian sport,"" Naidu wrote.

India's performance at Tokyo Olympics has rekindled tremendous interest in various sports, especially among youngsters, he felt.

""This bodes well for the future of Indian sport. Needless to add, this is an opportune time for us to promote sports across the length and breadth of the country.

""We need to create the right ecosystem for sports and games to thrive from schools to universities by building the necessary infrastructure at every level,"" said.

The vice president also flagged the issue of mindset of people towards sports.

""I have come across many instances where parents discourage their children from seeking a career in sports. While the anxiety of parents is understandable to a large extent, it should be noted that more and more industries, as well as governments, are providing employment to sportspersons,"" he noted and called for more job avenues in government and corporate sector for sportspersons.

""If we can effectively make sports a financially rewarding and secure career option, many young men and women would be encouraged to shed their inhibitions to take up sports as a full-time activity,"" he said.

The country's sole focus in sports should not remain on increasing medal tally alone, he felt.

""Rather we have to create an overall ecosystem where sports become an intrinsic part of our daily lives. This would be an important step towards creating a healthy and fit India. For such a sporting culture to take root, we also need to revive our traditional Indian sports,"" Naidu wrote.

He said he was happy that the government, under its flagship Khelo India scheme has created an exclusive component for promotion of 'rural, indigenous and tribal games' including Kalaripayatu, Silambam, Kabaddi and Archery."

Though Dhyan Chand himself led the Indian team (under British rule) to three consecutive Olympic gold medals (in 1928, 1932 and 1936), it was at the 1948 London Summer Games that Independent India defeated hosts Great Britain 4-0 to win their first Olympic gold post Independence.

Two years later in 1950, Abdul Bari attained individual glory as he reached the British Open squash final, but lost to Egyptian Mahmoud Karim.

In 1951, India hosted the Asian Games in New Delhi, the first major sporting event as an independent nation and, led by the magic of Sailen Manna, went on to win the gold medal in football. India went on to repeat the feat at the 1962 Jakarta Asian Games.

Saina Nehwal became the first Indian woman to win a Super Series Tournament in 2009, beating China’s Lin Wan in Jakarta.At the 2011 Cricket World Cup, India did what no other team had ever done before, as the MS Dhoni team became the first to win the CWC at home. In the final, Dhoni promoted himself up the batting order and finished things off with a six as India defeated Sri Lanka to be champions after a wait of 28 years.

The 2012 London Olympics was a landmark event for India as the nation produced their best ever medal haul with six medals - two silvers and four bronze. Shooter Vijay Kumar and wrestler Sushil won silver medals while shooter Gagan Narang, boxer Mary Kom, wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt and shuttler Saina Nehwal claimed for bronze medals.

Stuart, 37, began his career with his state Karnataka and represented India in six Tests, 14 ODIs and three Twenty20 Internationals.

“The game of cricket runs through my blood, and I will always look to give back to the game that has given me everything,” said Stuart, whose father Roger Binny was a member of the 1983 World Cup winning team. “I just felt it’s time for me to move on from a player to coaching…and I have a lot to give back to cricket in that department… also now since I am a level 2 coach with the NCA, he added.

“I would like to inform you that I have decided to retire from first-class and international cricket. It has given me tremendous joy and pride to have represented my country at the highest international level.”

Stuart still holds the record of the Best ODI Bowling by an Indian. His figures of 4.4-2-4-6 came against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2014. He had bettered the record of his compatriot and leg-spinner legend Anil Kumble, whose six-wicket haul against the West Indies in 1993 but had conceded 12 runs.

Stuart represented Karnataka in 95 first-class matches and under Mahendra Singh Dhoni, he debuted against England in July 2014 when he scored 78 in his second innings and that remained his only fifty in his six Tests. A 31-run over in a T20 game against the West Indies in Florida, the US ended his international career where Evin Lewis hit him for five sixes and never recovered and was trolled by cricket fans rather nastily.

He played 6 Tests, 14 ODIs and 3 T20Is scoring a total of 459 runs and picking up 24 wickets.

Stuart is best known as a player who punched above his weight and did his best even his famous father Roger relinquished his selection committee post due to conflict of interest.

Stuart thanked the BCCI, his various teams, fellow players and coaches for the role played in his growth as a cricketer."

The 41-year-old BSF man, whose Army man father was injured during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, produced a best throw of 19.91m to finish third behind Piotr Kosewicz (20.02m) of Poland and Velimir Sandor (19.98m) of Croatia on Sunday.

However, the result was challenged by some competitors.

“…the panel was unable to allocate the athlete Vinod Kumar from NPC India with a sport class and the athlete was designated as Classification not Completed (CNC),” the organisers said in a statement.

“The athlete is therefore ineligible for the Men’s F52 Discus medal event and his results in that competition are void,” it added.

F52 is for athletes with impaired muscle power, restricted range of movement, limb deficiency or leg length difference, with athletes competing in seated position with cervical cord injury, spinal cord injury, amputation, and functional disorder.

Para-athletes are classified depending on the type and extent of their disability. The classification system allows athletes to compete those with a similar level of ability.

It appears in Jatin Paranjpe’s heartfelt ode to his father, ‘The Cricket Drona- for the love of Vasoo Paranjpe’, a book of gratitude from many cricketers whose lives he touched, shaped and formed before retreating silently into the shadows.

Powar breaks down as he recounts his emotional debts to his “sir”. The young Powar had lost his father, his brain addled with self-doubts, his soul weary of the game when Paranjpe came calling. “While I thought I was a nobody, Vasoo Sir had faith in me. I won’t call him my guru, because a guru is someone who just teaches you. To me, he is much more than that: a guiding light that appeared in my life at the right time. Without him, I would have been nowhere,” Powar sobs in the presence of the co-author Anand Vasu.

It’s a familiar theme in the life of Paranjpe: A flamboyant character who first awes people and later becomes their Jambavan, the mythical character from Ramayana who made Hanuman realise his capabilities and motivated him to fly across oceans.

Really sad to hear about Vasoo Paranjape ji. My deepest condolences and may his soul rest in peace. 🙏 — Vinod Kambli (@vinodkambli349) August 30, 2021

Really saddened at the demise of Vasoo Paranjape. He was an institution in the game with a real positive vibe in whatever he did. Condolences to @jats72 and the family. God bless his soul 🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/LlIkaB242Q — Ravi Shastri (@RaviShastriOfc) August 30, 2021

Saddened to hear the passing of Vasu Paranjape. Two years of my formative years at the National camp was a great learning under his tutelage. He will be missed. My condolences to @jats72 and family. 🙏🏽 — Anil Kumble (@anilkumble1074) August 30, 2021 https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png

It was Paranjpe who Sachin Tendulkar thanks for his early climb up the cricketing ladder. “Yeh lagne wala player nahi, Lagane wala player hai,” Tendulkar recalls Paranjpe’s words to the late Raj Singh Dungarpur which convinced the board president to take a leap of faith on a 16-year old. It was Paranjpe who told a 14-year old Rahul Dravid, who was playing as a second wicket-keeper who could bat a bit, that “you are going to play for India but not as a wicketkeeper”.

It was Paranjpe who first recognised and made Anil Kumble, who had come to a camp as a batsman, realise that he could be a good leg spinner instead. The book has an extremely cute letter from a 17-year old Kumble to his “dear sir” where he informs about his admission to an engineering college – “One of the best in Bangalore”, an ankle injury and typhoid that disrupted his cricketing season and ends with “I hope I will make up for the loss this year. Wishing you a very happy New Year”. It tells so much about trust, love, and openness in the relationship.

Hopeful novices and grizzly veterans turned to him for validation and direction. It’s Paranjpe whom Gavaskar turned for clarity in his career, apologising for a bad shot with a promise he would make up in the next – a cracking double hundred against West Indies in 1983. Only Paranjpe can comment with authority about Gavaskar, a great batsman with almost unparalleled achievements: “He still couldn’t do justice, I believe, to his stroke-making talents.” Or … “It has been remarked that Sunny did not always face the best bowling attacks. For my part, I always believed Sunny could play a convincing innings against any formidable attack.” A compliment that almost reads like a sigh about what could have been about a batsman who first broke the 10,000 run barrier. He knew which buttons to press, how to tailor it according to the stature of the players. Whom to inspire by talking them up, who to inspire by reminding they could do more.

In his tribute in the book, Rohit Sharma calls Paranjpe as his “father figure”. Impressed with what he saw in the nets, Paranjpe had a quiet word with the captain and drafted Sharma in the U-17 team. And kept shaping his game in the ensuing years. Sharma writes about how he would ask, “anything?”, and would eagerly await Paranjpe’s feedback about his game even in the latter days. “When I look back, I realize how shrewdly Sir had forged the path that led me to the world stage of cricket. I was not from a big club or a big school or a college team. I was an outlier. But Sir’s recommendations to Pravin Amre, Kiran More and Dilip Vengsarkar got people talking about me, and I delivered on that promise. Without Sir by my side in those early years, I would not have been able to achieve as much as I fortunately have.”

There is something so ‘Malgudi Days’ about the life of Paranjpe as described in the book. The thumbs up beverage that Paranjpe sipped after three of his teeth were knocked out by a bouncer in a club game, the old rickety car he would drive to matches, the spotless cricketing attire that even Gavaskar would admire. The little moments in a club game for his beloved ‘Dadar Union’, the endearing cussedness of a Vijay Patil, Paranjpe’s friend and team-mate who wouldn’t let the players celebrate with beer, Ajay Jadeja’s hilarious first memory of “buddha pagal hai” (the old man is mad)… the list is endless.

Not many sportsbooks whisk us to our childhood days. Jatin Paranjpe’s Cricket Drona is one of the happy exceptions. Page after page, famous cricketers across India and even abroad pay their guru-dakshina to the popular cricket mentor but the aftertaste that lingers is something beyond even Vasoo Paranjpe. By conveying his unadulterated love for the game and his hand in their fate, the cricketers yank us to a state of cricketing adolescence. If he could do that to us, mere fans of this great game, imagine the effect on the cricketers who play it. No wonder, he has earned such love, respect, and gratitude from all cricketers. He saw in them what they couldn’t see, a mark of a true margdarshak."

The Prime Minister had first used the slogan ‘Sabka Prayas’ during his Independence Day speech this year.

During the 80th edition of his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme on Sunday, the Prime Minister said, “This is the period of 75 years of Independence. This year, we have to make a new resolve, think new every day, and increase our zest to do something new. When India will complete the centenary of Independence, then these resolutions will reflect in the foundation of its successes. So, we cannot let this opportunity go. We have to contribute our maximum efforts to this.”

Remembering hockey legend Major Dhyanchand on his birth anniversary, which is celebrated as National Sports Day, the PM said, “I was thinking, wherever his soul may be, he must be extremely pleased. Because Dhyanchand ji conquered the world of hockey for India… India’s sons and daughters have once again instilled new life into Indian hockey.

“No matter how many medals we win, until we win a medal in hockey, Indians cannot fully enjoy the victory. And this time, we did win an Olympic medal in hockey, after a gap of four decades,” he said.

The Prime Minister urged people to also pick up other sports. “Be it at home or outside, in villages or in towns, our sports grounds must be full. Sab khelen, sab khilen [Everyone should play, everyone should blossom],” he said. “Through ‘Sabka Prayas’ [everyone’s contribution], India can attain the height in sports which it deserves… All of us should strive to further this momentum… Let us transform the mantra of ‘Sabka Prayas’ into reality.”

Wishing people on the eve of Janmashtami, the Prime Minister urged people to understand the science behind festivals. “Friends, when people across the world think so highly of Indian spirituality and philosophy, then it is our responsibility to carry forward our glorious traditions… Let us celebrate our festivals by understanding the science behind them and understanding their meaning,” he said.

The Prime Minister also spoke at length about Lord Krishna and discussed the artworks of Jadurani Dasi, an American devotee and ISKCON follower. He said, “We are aware of all the forms of the lord, from the naughty Kanhaiya to the Krishna who assumes the Virat Swarup. From the master of scriptures to the master of weapons, be it art, beauty or sweetness, Shri Krishna is everywhere.”

The Prime Minister also extolled the virtues of Sanskrit, saying the language helps strengthen cultural ties between nations. He appreciated the contributions of Rutger Kortenhorst, a Sanskrit scholar and teacher in Ireland; Dr Chirapat Prapandavidya and Dr Kusuma Rakshamani in Thailand; and Boris Zakharin, who teaches Sanskrit at Moscow State University in Russia in promoting the language in their countries."

And therefore, such films continue to be announced. Ex-cricketer Sourav Ganguly confirmed recently that he has given his nod to a biopic, while Ajay Devgn already has Maidaan, centered on football, lined up.

Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, alongwith husband Nitesh Tiwary, are making a web series on Tennis duo Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi. Ashwiny tells us, “Sports and sportspeople will always be there to live a story of inspiration and aspiration. With the changing times and the youngsters of our country either taking up sports themselves or following it religiously, it is important to keep nurturing minds with different kinds of sports stories.”

Adding that it’s not what we say, but how we say it, Tiwari continues, “Sports stories in any medium will always have a repeat value and significant takeaways each time we consume them.”

Trade expert Atul Mohan feels the recent Olympic achievements will of course lead to a spurt in the number of sports films, but the fact that all the projects mentioned here were announced much before the event says a lot. “Taapsee Pannu was doing Shabaash Mithu (biopic on cricketer Mithali Raj) and Rashmi Rocket. In the past, MS Dhoni- The Untold Story, Mary Kom, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, all had different sports, and all of them were successful. Now, the story telling pattern has changed, generic rom-coms don’t work. People want something motivational, inspiring stories. What’s better than a patriotic film, or sports biopic that will inspire people. That’s why every studio is aiming at atleast one sports film today,” he reasons.

Another biopic in the offing is one on woman track and field athlete Pinki Pramanik. Ashoke Pandit, who has announced it, says he found it to be a very interesting story, fit for a film. He tells us, “It is not only a film based on sports, but also how Pinki underwent torture, where she was framed for rape and for being a man. The way she was put in prison where there were men, then her sex determination test video was leaked, the way she fought the system, mafia and stood back again… when my writer Priyanka Ghatak narrated this, I said this is the film we have to make.”

He agrees that in the current times, such stories become even more important. “It will be an inspiration to all those athletes who are coming up, to take this up in the future,” adds Pandit.

Exhibitor Akshaye Rathi says sports is one genre in films which can bring a lot of thrills for a good cinematic experience. That is important when one takes into account how the need of the hour is to get people to visit theatres in order for them to sustain.

“If captured right, sportsperson films can really create solid play around making an engaging narrative for a couple of hours. Whether it’s football or athletics, sports lend themselves phenomenally to cinematic formats, as long as they are done right. It’s terrific opportunity to utilise,” he says."

The 40-year-old, who won gold in Athens 2004 and Rio 2016, clinched silver in the ongoing Tokyo Paralympics. Jhajharia's quest for his third medal in the Games was fulfilled after a personal best throw of 64.35.

""I want to thank every citizen of the country who prayed for me. My aim was for gold but in sports, there are ups and downs. But it's good that I have registered a hat-trick of medals for India. I am extremely happy,"" an emotional Jhajharia told ANI.

The Indian para-athlete thanked his parents for the constant support and said his daughter wanted gold but he is happy to win a silver medal.

""I want to thank my parents who sent me to the ground for taking up the sport and my coaches. I am feeling happy and will meet my daughter. She had called me yesterday and said 'papa gold medal jeetna hai' but I won a silver medal, I am happy,"" said Jhajharia.

The Indian javelin thrower registered a score of 60.28, 60.62 in his first two attempts before firing 64.35 to clinch silver. Jhajharia said it was his experience of facing pressure situations that helped him come with a good throw after a decent start.

""My experience came in handy today as I had the experience of tackling pressure. My third throw was good. At one point in time, I was not in contention for a medal but my confidence and my willpower made it possible,"" said Jhajharia.

Meanwhile, javelin thrower Sundar Singh Gurjar captured bronze with a season-best throw of 62.58. (ANI)"

322,Why sports funding in India is an obstacle race - Mint,https://www.livemint.com/sports/news/why-funding-sports-is-an-olympian-hurdle-11629131150905.html,Mint,https://www.livemint.com,sports,"BENGALURU : In 2019-20, the entire budget for the organization that governs hockey in India amounted to ₹48 crore. This was the pool of funds available with Hockey India to pay players and coaches, hold competitive events, support state units, build sports infrastructure, and promote the game. By comparison, the body that governs cricket in India earned an income of about ₹4,000 crore in 2018-19.

The bane of sports in India beyond cricket is that the combined income of all the sporting federations put together won’t even add up to a quarter of cricket’s. And it is barely growing. For instance, in 2009-10, the income of Hockey India was ₹33 crore, which shows the paltry growth over one decade. Even of the ₹48 crore in 2019-20, ₹7.6 crore went towards running its own office, including legal expenses of ₹3.5 crore.

If this was a private corporation that was accountable to its shareholders, heads would be rolling. Be it financial, structural or building a sporting ethos, the imperative for Indian hockey, and other sports, has to be greater. While Tokyo 2020 was India’s most successful Olympic campaign, it is also tempered by the feeling that it could have delivered more.

View Full Image Get set, go

An essential fuel to enable that is the support extended to Indian sportspersons. The Indian sporting framework beyond cricket sits on four pillars. The first, and the main one, is the Union government. Then, there are sporting federations, state governments and the private sector.

Until the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, support from the Union government had been increasing. The trajectory, though, was uneven. Between 2015-16 and 2018-19, the annual increase in budget allocation by the Centre on sports ranged from 3-10%. During the run-up to Tokyo Olympics in 2019-20, the spending surged 57% to ₹ 2,327 crore. But in 2020-21, the pandemic year that also compelled organizers of the Olympics to postpone the sporting event by a year, it tumbled 31% to ₹ 1,601 crore.

The corporate sector’s support to build Indian sport (beyond advertising and private leagues) is significantly small compared to the government. Classified as corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, private sector investments in Indian sports account for about ₹250-300 crore in a year.

This overall outlay, as well as the vision and execution, pales in comparison to successful sporting nations such as UK and Australia, which finished fourth and sixth, respectively, in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Adjusted for population, their Olympic medal hauls are among the best. Australia’s sports budget in 2020-21 was around $370 million Australian dollars (about ₹1,850 crore). India, with a population of about 50 times Australia, spent 14% less. The dramatic transformation of UK as an Olympic behemoth offers hope for India. Following a dismal show in the 1996 Olympics, where it finished 36, Britain has over the years overhauled its sports landscape. Sports management was professionalized, and UK Sport, a government agency, was set up as a singular entity to enhance its Olympic medal count. In 2019-20, it spent £146 million (about ₹1,500 crore). India can draw lessons from the turnaround models that other countries have adopted.

Central advance and retreat

Whatever money the Indian government spends on sports is channelled via the ministry of youth affairs and sports. The Union budget outlay on sports is classified under two broad categories. The first is ‘encouragement and awards to sportspersons’, which includes support to sports federations, awards and incentives. The second is the ‘Khelo India’ scheme, which aims to build a culture of sports in India from the grassroots, and upwards via infrastructure, competition, and opportunities.

However, the actual spend under both these initiatives has been lower than the budgeted amount in recent years. For instance, the ₹428 crore expenditure under the flagship Khelo India scheme was just 42% of the budgeted ₹1,015 crore. The spend on encouragement and awards to sportspersons increased from ₹317 crore in 2018-19 to ₹494 crore in 2019-20 due to targeted schemes for Olympians. But with the Olympics postponed by a year, this tumbled to ₹180 crore in 2020-21 (see Chart 1).

As per the Indian Constitution, sports come under the ambit of states, and there is no law governing sporting activities for the entire country. To address this issue, the Union ministry of youth affairs and sports notified the National Sports Development Code in 2011, which specified the principles for good governance of all national sports federations (NSFs). However, there is a lack of clarity over whether these principles are binding on various sporting bodies and institutions. In addition to the NSFs, the key government stakeholders managing sports are the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and the Indian Olympics Association (IOA).

The sporting entities in India have a legacy of fiefdoms, opaqueness, corruption and a lack of compliance, which has even resulted in bans from the international agencies. In addition, these federations have struggled to raise finances. Even with just ₹48 crore, Hockey India is one of the better-endowed federations in India. The shooting federation reported an income of ₹26 crore in 2019-20, the boxing federation ₹23.4 crore in 2018-19 (the latest period available), and the athletics federation ₹3.4 crore in 2019-20. These are sums that would be the marketing budget of a mid-sized company.

Direct to sportspersons

Government funding for athletes in India is broadly through assistance to sports federations along with incentives and support for promising individuals. In 2020-21, the Centre spent ₹180 crore on sports federations, incentives, and the National Sports Development Fund (NSDF). The NSDF, managed by a council instituted by the Union government, is the nodal fund through which assistance is routed to sportspersons. In addition to the Centre, states, corporates and individual citizens can contribute to the NSDF. In the 20 years of the NSDF, non-government donors, led by public sector undertakings, have contributed about ₹160 crore to the fund. These funds are then disbursed to athletes and sports foundations based on a review of applications. According to the 2018-19 NSDF annual report, a sum of ₹61.3 crore was disbursed to 386 sportspersons across 22 disciplines till 2018-19. Shooting received the most ( ₹28 crore), followed by athletics ( ₹9.6 crore). Another ₹116 crore was distributed to 80 sports federations and private institutes.

For the 2020 Tokyo Olympics specifically, a programme called the Target Olympic Podium or TOPS scheme was established in 2014 under the NSDF to identify and support medal prospects. This scheme was refurbished in April 2018 to establish a technical support team to manage TOPS athletes and provide more comprehensive support. TOPS provides funding for foreign training, international competition, equipment and coaching camps, besides a monthly stipend of ₹50,000 for each sportsperson. For Tokyo, 162 sportspersons across 26 disciplines and 58 members of the men’s and women’s hockey teams were supported through TOPS. Athletics had the highest representation with 33 of them receiving support through the scheme, followed by shooting with 16 sportspersons.

While TOPS has been hailed by many sportspersons, it has its drawbacks. For instance, a sportsperson only becomes eligible on qualification for the Olympics. Golfer Aditi Ashok, who came within a whisker of a medal in Tokyo, could not benefit from TOPS since she only qualified 60 days before the main event.

Even the monthly stipend of ₹50,000 has been deemed to be too low, given that several professional athletes hail from underprivileged backgrounds and have families to support. There is also a glaring disparity between the salaries of sportspersons and cricketers, who draw multi-crore salaries.

Private sector play

Indian athletes also benefit from support from various businesses. Private sector funding for sports in India is done primarily through three modes: public-private partnerships (PPP), for-profit academies and corporate social responsibility. Some of India’s largest corporations such as the Tata Group, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and the JSW Group have had a legacy of supporting Indian sports. In addition to corporations, there are also non-profit players such as the Olympic Gold Quest, which offers financial support to promising athletes by raising funds from individual and corporate philanthropists.

CSR has been the main vehicle for private sector investments in sports in India. In 2018-19, a total of 556 corporations cumulatively pumped ₹295 crore into sports. This went towards developing grassroots sports facilities, setting up and supporting existing sports academies, and developing individual sports such as football and swimming. In 2019-20, for the first time in six years, this fell to ₹263 crore. RIL was the leader in CSR sports expenditure in 2018-19, with ₹41 crore. It was followed by Hindustan Zinc Ltd, Reliance Retail and Kotak Mahindra Bank (see Chart 2). What’s lacking in private support are funding instances where the vision is big and is matched by a funding commitment over several years. For example, in 2018-19, there were only 13 instances of a corporate making a sports grant of above ₹5 crore.

The PPP model for sports development also remains constrained due to the lack of a standardized model and a lack of incentives for states to integrate PPP into their sports policies, according to a 2016 report co-authored by consultancy KPMG and the industry body Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). The report tilted Business of Sports also highlights successful PPP interventions, such as JSW’s engagement with SAI in Hisar, Haryana.

While monetary support for sports is rising, albeit slowly, there is also a need for certain reforms in order to transform India into a truly significant sporting behemoth. According to the KPMG report, the following interventions will be crucial. Private sector organizations and non-profits will have to be incentivized to participate in sports development through a combination of monetary and tax incentives. Since sports is a high-risk vocation, it is imperative that adequate financial security is provided to athletes to enable a more lucrative career. Further, sporting federations should be governed by former sportspersons with a proven ability to lead sporting bodies, rather than politicians or bureaucrats. Lastly, the PPP route should be harnessed to develop world-class sporting infrastructure. In the US, sports is well integrated with the education system, with college sports competitions being popular as well as rigorous.

The shining performance of India’s sportspersons in Tokyo, many of whom overcame significant odds, shows that there is no dearth of talent in India. However, to identify, groom and nurture promising prospects for world-beating athletes will require concerted effort, investment and cooperation among all key stakeholders of the sports industry in India.

323,Ivy League sports return as way they went out: cautiously - Boston.com,https://www.boston.com/sports/college-sports/2021/08/30/ivy-league-sports-return-as-way-they-went-out-cautiously/,Boston.com,https://www.boston.com,sports,"College Sports Ivy League sports return as way they went out: cautiously “You don’t always appreciate how much you miss something until it’s taken from you.” The schools and players are taking the utmost caution to ensure the return of practices and games, something they have been unable to do since March 2020.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — The Ivy League was the first conference to scuttle its basketball postseason when the pandemic broke out during March Madness a year and a half ago. It was the first Division I conference to suspend fall sports in July 2020.

Now the schools are getting back on the field the same way they left: cautiously.

All eight Ivies are requiring that their football teams be vaccinated for COVID-19 — just like the rest of the students on campus. Ivy League executive director Robin Harris said this month that the goal had been reached with “very limited medical or religious” exceptions.

“While COVID-19 is very much a part of our lives, we believe in the campus policies,” she said. “This allows us to plan for a regular football season.”

Although the alliance of eight prestigious private schools in the Northeast has always been more about academics than athletics, the Ivy League decision to cancel its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments before anyone else on March 10, 2020, was a turning point in the response to the pandemic. Other college and professional leagues soon followed amid a worldwide sports shutdown.

In the almost 18 months since, the Ivies have remained idle with the exception of scattered individuals or teams competing in some one-off, nonconference events, including the NCAA rowing championships. That ended when all eight women’s soccer teams opened their seasons on Aug. 27, with Harvard playing Fairfield in the Crimson’s first intercollegiate sporting event since March 8, 2020.

“You don’t always appreciate how much you miss something until it’s taken from you,” Harvard football coach Tim Murphy said.

Since then, players were able to do different things to stay in shape, depending on restrictions in their home states or countries. And because of the varied local restrictions, players returned this fall in a wide rage of fitness levels.

“I think we did the best job we possibly could have, and it’s going to show this season,” Brown running back Allen Smith said. “It’s been a long time coming, so we could not be more excited to get back to Brown football.”

Brown did have spring football practice, but Columbia had few students — and thus, players — on campus last fall, and mostly seniors in the spring; Harvard had some freshman last fall and a small contingent in the spring.

Murphy said his team will have just eight padded practices in almost two years between its 50-43, double-overtime loss to Yale in The Game and its 2021 opener Sept. 18 at Georgetown.

“We’ve all had different on-campus footprints,” he said. “It does leave a lot of question marks.”

As they return, players will face new protocols to combat the spread of the delta variant.

In addition to the vaccine requirement, Dartmouth players will wear masks indoors, with improved air filtration and circulation; some meetings on the Hanover, New Hampshire, campus will be held outdoors. Cambridge has a city-wide indoor mask mandate that goes into effect on Sept. 3.

“Harvard’s done a remarkable job, making sure that students — and the student athletes, therefore — are healthy and well,” Murphy said. “I know that our medical folks have done a phenomenal job, and whatever they tell us to do, we’re 100% going to do it.”

Penn coach Ray Priore said he reached out to coaches who played or practiced in the spring — including his brother, Chuck, who is the head coach at Stony Brook. Chip Kelly at UCLA also passed along a little advice for ramping things up after the long layoff: “Less is more.”

Advertisement:

“You grab some of those tidbits and wisdoms: How many reps do you really need; do more with walkthroughs. The key thing is how we maximize our time with our players,” Priore said. “We’ve been in the Zoom world for a long time.”

Princeton coach Bob Surace noted that his team now includes five different classes — itself a big change — and two of them he’s never met. Dartmouth’s Buddy Teevens also said he was anxious to actually see his players in person.

“I don’t completely know what these guys look like,” he said. “The guy that says he’s 6-5, 280, he could be 5-11 just wearing a big coat.”

Key Highlights Fasting is often used as a method of weight and diet management Fasting can be a healthy and enriching experience if carried out appropriately Here are some tips that can help you ensure a safe and healthy Janmashtami fasting

New Delhi: 30 August is being observed as Janmashtami in 2021. This festival marks the birth of one of Lord Vishnu’s most famous reincarnates, Lord Krishna. Vibrant celebrations of this auspicious day take place in parts of India and people celebrate it with utmost happiness and enthusiasm. Along with the scrumptious meal preparation and dahi handi ceremony, fasting is also an important part of the celebration. Fasting is a part of various cultures across the world and can offer several health benefits such as weight management, detoxification, and improved digestive system and metabolism. Apart from celebrating faith and culture while fasting, it is important to ensure health and safety for a smooth and enriching experience.

Janmashtami fasting tips

Here are some tips that can help you ensure safe and healthy fasting:

Pick a healthy pre-fasting meal: A pre-fasting meal is important to ensure that your body possesses the energy to get through the fasting sessions without any complications. Therefore, remember to fast smartly and add a good amount of protein, fibre, and healthy calories to your pre-fasting meal. Do not load up on processed foods and saturated fats. Stay hydrated: Dehydration is a common issue faced by people during fasting sessions. It is important to keep the body hydrated because dehydration can lead to a weakened body that can result in fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and migraines. To avoid such complications, make sure that you provide your body with sufficient fluids to keep it functioning efficiently throughout the day. Avoid energy loss: Fasting can cause some people to be fatigued and low on energy which can pose a hindrance to a fruitful and healthy fasting experience. To prevent this from happening, avoid exertion on the body by indulging in strenuous activities such as workouts and sports to make sure that your body does not lose energy unnecessarily. Do not forget fruits: Fruits are an incredible source of fibre, antioxidants, and other essential nutrients that can contribute greatly to providing the body with the lost energy during fasting sessions. Feel free to load up on healthy foods such as berries, apples, and nuts, grapes to reenergize your body and mind. Furthermore, fruits have a water content that can also aid the body’s hydration. Ensure a filling post-fasting meal: Ending a fast after a day’s efforts is surely an unwinding and relieving process. Fulfil your body’s nutrition requirements by consuming a filling meal consisting of fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Avoid ultra-processed foods and meats for healthier results.

402,Living space and health: Does urban design affect our health? - Medical News Today,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/living-space-and-health-how-urban-design-affects-our-well-being,Medical News Today,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com,health,"Urban and housing design has intimate connections to health. Poor design choices can worsen health, with underlying issues of inequality a driving factor. Share on Pinterest Where we live, and the design of our living spaces have a significant impact on health. Andrew Thomas/Getty Images Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family.” This includes housing, food, clothing, medical care, social services, and security if events beyond a person’s control affect their livelihood. Researchers have shown that adequate housing has intimate links to a person’s physical and mental well-being. According to the Executive Summary of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Housing and Health Guidelines , poorly designed housing can increase the risk of trips, falls, injury, isolation, and stress for older people or people with disabilities. Further, insecure or unaffordable housing can exacerbate stress. Housing that is too hot or cold or exacerbates indoor air pollution can cause respiratory and cardiometabolic issues. Crowded housing or housing with a poor water supply can increase the spread of infectious diseases. Speaking to Medical News Today, Robert Huxford, Director of the Urban Design Group, London, said that questions around the relationship between health and urban or housing design have a long history. “It’s often forgotten that the links between housing and urban design and health go back hundreds of years, such as the 19th-century public health movement, including the Health of Towns Association of the 1840s, or the Model Byelaws issued in the 1870s, that governed urban development in England for the next 50 years.” “They focused on lighting, ventilation, overcrowding, damp, and sanitation. They specified the minimum width of streets, minimum spaces around buildings, and that habited rooms should have a window at least one-tenth of the floor area. Over 100 years on, developers are bringing forward proposals for windowless flats.” For Huxford, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought historical concerns around housing and infectious diseases back to the fore. “In the 19th century, the main causes of death were infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, cholera, and typhoid,” said Huxford. “The public health works of the 19th and 20th-century saw infectious disease brought under control, further aided by advances in medical science. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that we remain vulnerable to infectious disease; and the prospect of drug-resistant diseases is a grave international concern.” “It is of the utmost importance that housing and urban design provides resilience to infectious disease risk.” Backing up Huxford’s point in an article in the journal PLOS ONE , researchers found an association between the amount of poor quality housing in a United States county and COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

Car-dependent development According to Katja Stille, Chair of the Urban Design Group and Director of Tibbalds Planning and Urban Design, broader urban design choices can have direct adverse effects on a person’s health. Speaking to MNT, Stille said, “the main urban factors that negatively affect a person’s mental and physical health are air pollution from road traffic as well as noise pollution.” “Living in a car-dependent development will impact negatively on people’s ability to exercise and encourage a sedentary lifestyle that easily leads to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. The opportunity to be physically active throughout one’s day-to-day life, such as active transport — walking and cycling — is important to avoid obesity.” Dr. Steven Fleming, author of Velotopia: The Production of Cyclespace in Our Minds and Our Cities, also highlights the issue of car-centric urban design. Dr. Fleming said to MNT that a “house with a garage is designed to send you on your way driving, for a day of no exercise whatsoever. An apartment block is only slightly better because the day of walking it was designed to set in motion — with its lift or stairs leading onto the street — will have negligible metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes. If you [already have overweight], you’ll be looking for a taxi or bus because walking is painful for [people with obesity].” The definition of one MET is “the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest.” “In my book Velotopia,” continued Dr. Fleming, “I detailed, in drawings and architectural jargon, apartment-style housing that would set you on your way on your bike. You would leave your tenth story apartment, and rather than waiting for a slow lift, just ride past all the other apartments arranged around a sloping, typically spiraling, corridor or what we call an ‘access gallery’ or sometimes an ‘aerial street.’” “That would be the start of a day with far more MET-minutes than the one you started on foot, and that wouldn’t be painful if you [have obesity].” Robert Huxford also has issues with designs that prioritize motor vehicles: “The impact of motor vehicles is significant, bringing noise, high intensity street lighting, air pollution, and the risk of injury from collisions into urban areas.”

Mental health Housing and urban design issues can also adversely affect mental health. Speaking to MNT, Dr. Layla McCay, Director of the Centre for Urban Design and Mental Health, said that “homelessness and housing insecurity are a key risk factor for mental health problems.” “For those who do have a home, the affordability of the home is key, as economic concerns have links to mental health problems; so too is the quality of the housing, including dampness, noise, pests, and overcrowding.” “Location of the housing is also important, including neighborhood quality and safety, access to key facilities, including education, jobs, and healthcare. And any aspect of the housing that stigmatizes its residents can also negatively affect residents’ mental health.” “Housing that is available, safe, adequate, affordable, and comfortable, and that offers its residents a degree of privacy, while also facilitating multi-generational living where desired, can benefit people’s mental health,” she continued. “Housing has the opportunity to further support people’s mental health by facilitating residents to develop positive relationships with their neighbors, and to foster feelings of inclusion and belongingness.”

Security and homelessness As Dr. McCay highlights, the security of housing — whether a person owns their home or cannot keep up with the mortgage; whether they have a long-term rental contract; or whether they face the possibility of eviction with no notice — can be just as important a factor for a person’s well-being as the physical conditions of the home. Prof. Deborah K. Padgett of the Silver School of Social Work in New York University, an expert on the intersection of homelessness and mental or substance use disorders, spoke with MNT. She explained that while insecure housing is a complex topic, it has some key root causes. “Global housing instability is due to severe poverty and lack of institutional support for ‘public’ or ‘social’ housing that is affordable.” “The United Nations-endorsed concept of ‘housing is a right’ is, in my opinion, the most contested and least attractive of human rights supposedly guaranteed by governments. This is in part because demand so overwhelms supply as world population growth soars.” “But the last decades (since the Reagan administration here in the U.S.) have seen heavy privatization of housing development, and this naturally excludes the poor. In countries like India, the millions living in slums are not considered ‘homeless,’ but this obscures the deplorable living conditions they endure.” “From a personal level, day-to-day survival is a struggle to procure food, clean water, sanitary facilities, etc. — whether living in a slum, a shantytown, or on a park bench,” said Prof. Padgett. For Prof. Padgett, a primary factor that affects the relationship between housing and mental health is homelessness. However, people too often presume that mental health issues cause homelessness when the reality is not straightforward — a point Prof. Padgett recently outlined in an article for the journal BJPsych Bulletin. Prof. Padgett told MNT that “homelessness and mental health have a bi-directional relationship, but it’s also complicated. While serious mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, account for a minority of homeless persons, these individuals are more likely to be chronically homeless and have needs that create more costs for the system — hospitals, jails, shelters, and so on.” “They are also more likely to be visible in public and thus skew public perceptions away from the fact that most homeless people are families with small children, youth, ‘new’ homeless (older Baby Boomers), and others.” “Sadly, the hyper-focus on serious mental illness diverts attention from the trauma caused by being homeless, and this remains under-studied — in part because it is often trauma compounded by childhood adversity and traumatic events earlier in life.”

Inequality For Dr. McCay, an underlying issue in poor health associated with urban and housing design is wealth inequality. “Housing is inextricably linked to mental health and well-being, but access to housing and the quality of that housing varies according to a wide range of factors, particularly wealth,” said Dr. McCay. “Inequalities in people’s access to safe, affordable, good-quality housing can lead to inequalities in their mental health and well-being. People’s mental health can also be affected by ‘segregation by design,’ for example, where people who own their homes are separated by design features from people who live in social housing, even within the same building, creating stigma and exacerbating inequality.” “During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw evidence of housing-related inequalities where some people were able to relax and play in their gardens while others had no outside space; some had good quality local parks, and others had to travel outside their neighborhood to find safe and pleasant green space.” For Prof. Peter Bishop, a professor of urban design at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London, various forms of social deprivation, including poor housing and urban design, correlate with worse health outcomes. Speaking to MNT, Prof. Bishop said: “There is a clear correlation between physical and mental health and indices of multiple deprivation. Public Health England lists childhood experience, education, stable housing, and secure employment as the core contributing factors to health and well-being.”"

Parents and guardians have been seeking expert help on complaints ranging from learning difficulties to behavioural issues. The success of the Center can be gauged from the fact that nearly 10,000 children and adolescents were registered in 2019 alone. In 2020, even amidst the raging COVID19 pandemic, approximately 9000 registrations took place at the Center. However, the dearth of space at the building that also houses the De-Addiction Center posed constraints in operation.

Psychological First Aid was provided online and onsite to 1830 children during the pandemic. These children had suffered mental health issues due to lockdowns, being out of school, losing a family member, losing a friend, being confined and a number of other norms brought into their lives since 2020. “The pandemic has not been easy on any of us and the children are no exception. We have child psychiatrists, child psychologists, occupational therapists, remedial educators, speech therapists, social workers and so many other experts available here,” said Dr Arshad Hussain, who calls the CWGC a “dream come true”.

The 16 member team at the center is trained to provide Psychological First Aid, do assessment on various mental health parameters, including speech, intellectual and learning abilities, provide counseling and other interventions and create a healthy environment for children at their places of learning and living.

The teams from the Center have been taking mental health awareness messages out and around.

A group of young counselors has just returned from Gurez, while another one discusses its plan to go to remote areas of district Kupwara."
404,5 healthy snacks that can help you lose weight - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/5-healthy-snacks-that-can-help-you-lose-weight-101630223090812.html,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com,health,"Is snacking in between the meals a bad thing or good? This is the frequently asked question that people ask health experts or nutritionists. A lot depends on your motivation, say health studies. If you are genuinely hungry, or consume healthy and small portions of food throughout the day it is not harmful, but if boredom, temptation, emotional eating is your motivation, and you choose packaged food high on saturated fat, salt, or sugar to fulfill the craving, snacking can be the villain of your life.

""Snacking isn't harmful for you as long as you don't eat unhealthy items. Rather it can help you stay fuller for longer and reduce your cravings for unhealthy foods,"" says celebrity nutritionist Ryan Fernando.

When we are not mindful about our eating choices, we pick the wrong snacks off the shelf, and that could result in weight gain and lead to many health problems. ""Most products now say ""healthy"" on the label but are often high in added sugar and unhealthy fats. Snack options such as chips offer no or little nutritional value but are loaded with fats, sodium and are high in calories,"" adds Fernando.

ALSO READ: Top reasons you are not losing weight

Why we feel the urge to snack in between the meals?

It could be for a variety of reasons from nutritional deficiencies to genetics.

""This could be because of existing nutritional deficiencies or a lack of certain nutrients in your diet. For example, if you have an urge to snack on chocolate, you may have magnesium deficiency in the body, which can be fulfilled by having nuts, seeds and fruits,"" says Fernando.

""Genetics also plays a major role. You might have a gene that pokes you to eat every now and then. Do your gene test to discover if you have that gene and plan your diet accordingly,"" he says.

Fernando also suggests 5 healthy snacks that can act as substitute for unhealthy snacks and help you lose weight:

1. Fruit instead of candy or chocolate

Fruits are naturally high in antioxidants, fibre and water content and low in fat, sodium and calorie which helps keep you nourished and feel fuller for longer time. Not to mention who doesn’t love a fresh bowl of fruits.

2. Popcorn instead of chips

Fried chips are full of sodium and empty calories. Instead pop some maize and treat yourself to a delicious low calorie, fibre-rich snack which satisfies your appetite and at the same time adds variety to your diet.

3. Peanut butter toast instead of biscuits

Nut butters are a source of good fats in your diet, that help to maintain good cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure and are also good for your heart health. A teaspoon of peanut butter or almond butter on a multigrain or millet toast makes for a crunchy snack.

4. Cut carrots or cucumber instead of potato fries or wedge

If you are craving for those salty French fries, what your body actually needs is water, so choose high water content foods like cucumber or carrot and cut them up like sticks. Serve them with a hummus or hung curd dip which is a good protein source. These healthy sticks are also rich in fibre, antioxidants thus keeping you nourished and full.

Carrots and cucumbers are healthy snacks(Unsplash)

5. Fox Nut or puffed rice and chana instead of Namkeens

Namkeens are another high sodium, high fat, high calorie unhealthy snacks which can be replaced with fox nuts or puffed rice and chana mixture. As they are rich in fibre, they will keep you full. Along with that they are also a good source of nutrients like iron, magnesium, zinc which keep you energised.

Thyroid is a hormonal issue which affects a lot of women and men around the country, regardless of age.

On her Instagram account, Dr Anjali Kumar says that stress can definitely take a toll on your health, including your thyroid. “Keeping your stress levels in check, is key for your well-being,” she writes alongside a video, wherein she talks more about the hormonal issue.

“Whether it is hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, it is auto-immune. Which means the body’s own immune system goes on a drive against its own tissues. Why does that happen? It is the stress, worry, anxiety, the diet, pollution all together at play. So, do everything to take care of that stress and worry, and you will see your immune system cooperating and protecting your tissues,” she says.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Maitri | Dr Anjali Kumar (@maitriwoman)

In the caption, Dr Kumar also lists some ways to maintain your thyroid health: “Consuming a balanced diet, sleeping well, giving your body adequate time to relax and continuing to take your medications as advised by your doctor.”

ALSO READ | Suffering from thyroid? Here are foods to include in your diet

For the uninitiated, thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland, a small organ, located in the front of the neck, visibly wrapping around the windpipe (trachea). Just like other glands in the body, the thyroid also makes hormones — mainly thyroxine, which acts to increase metabolic rate, regulating growth and development — that help control many vital functions of your body.

When the thyroid gland does not function properly, it can impact your health. If your body produces too much thyroid hormone, you can develop a condition called hyperthyroidism, and if it produces too little, it can lead to hypothyroidism.

More information can be provided to you by a healthcare expert, but like Dr Kumar says, it is important to make some lifestyle tweaks so as to remain healthy.

407,Suffering from PCOS? Foods to lose weight and reverse the condition - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/suffering-from-pcos-foods-to-lose-weight-and-reverse-the-condition-101630243254255.html,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com,health,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder, affects one out of ten women in India. Women suffering from the condition may have infrequent or prolonged periods, increased levels of male hormones and insulin while the reproductive hormone progesterone is on the lower side. Obesity is said to worsen complications of the disorder, therefore it is advised to lose weight when you are suffering from PCOS.

A sedentary lifestyle and obesity are associated with increased risk of getting PCOS.

""Ideally an active workout of at least 150 minutes per day is recommended for maintaining a healthy weight, improving the heart health and over all mental well-being. This active workout includes cardio activity, own body weight workouts coupled with yogasanas. But due to the urban lifestyle, it is observed that there is less priority given to exercise. Along with this the food choices are skewed and there is more of empty calories coming from carbs and fats and less of protein and fruits and vegetables in the diet. This along with lack of exercise is a major contributor to being overweight or obese,"" says Avantii Deshpaande, PCOS and Gut health nutritionist.

ALSO READ: Trying for a baby? Here are foods to boost your fertility

Women suffering from PCOS report high insulin which makes them crave for more carbs and sweets. This leads to an extra calorie intake which could contribute towards obesity. So it is important to treat the insulin resistance and not just reduce the blood sugars, adds Deshpande.

To manage PCOS, Deshpande says, apart from losing weight it is important to detox the vital organs, improve gut health and make some healthy lifestyle changes.

She suggests the following foods to lose weight and reverse PCOS:

1. Take high-fibre diet

A high-fibre diet packed with anti-oxidants is recommended to detoxify the body and improve gut health. Fruits and vegetables being low in calories also ensure you do not end up consuming extra calories. Deshpande recommends at least 5 serving of fruits and vegetables in a day to manage the condition.

2. Include proteins

Proteins play an important role in the synthesis of hormones and provide body with a filling food. ""Include protein in every meal from breakfast, lunch to dinner. You can take dals, beans, eggs, curds, nuts and oil seeds,"" suggests Deshpande.

3. Probiotics

Probiotics are not only excellent for your gut health but also reduce inflammation and regulate hormones like estrogen and androgen. ""Make it a point to have atleast 1 glass of buttermilk in the day or ½ cup of fresh home-made curds. This will improve the gut health as they contain probiotics,"" the PCOS nutritionist says.

4. Omega 3 fatty acids

A daily dose of omega 3 fatty acids is known to improve the hormonal imbalance. ""Consume 1 tbsp of flax seeds, sunflower and melon seeds together in the day. You could also try seed cycling. Fish and fish oil tablets will also ensure you get omega 3 fatty acids,"" says Deshpande.

5. Herbal teas

Herbal teas like green tea or green coffee are also useful in boosting metabolism and could be consumed as a replacement for our regular tea and coffee.

6. Avoid milk and wheat

If inflammation is the cause of PCOS removing foods like milk and wheat from the diet for a few weeks will lead to weight loss, but this should be done under the supervision of an expert, says the nutritionist.

Other tips by Deshpande

Include at least 150 mins of workouts in the week which is equivalent to 20 minutes of exercise per day in the form of cardio, weight training and yoga.

Practicing Pranayama will reduce the stress and will also help to balance the hormones better.

You can reduce or stop the consumption of junk food for cutting out empty calories. Replace this with home cooked meals which are filled with nutrition.

Enjoy the journey towards eating healthy and make it a daily habit by following mindful eating, making healthy swaps and following a workout routine.

CHENNAI: With schools for higher classes and colleges reopening in Tamil Nadu from September 1, the main focus will be on emotional and mental health of the students as also the teaching and non-teaching staff, say expertsStudents have not attended physical classes since a long time, except for two months till the second wave of the pandemic struck earlier this year, leading to the shutting down of educational institutions.The Tamil Nadu government have already directed the management of schools and colleges as well as teachers and student counsellors to focus mainly on the mental and emotional health of students.The School Education Department has directed the management to engage the help of acclaimed professional counsellors to look after the mental well-being of students. An online study and survey conducted by the department has found that students were battling emotional disorders including anxiety and depression. Some students were facing panic attacks and displayed aggressive behaviour.Dr Sujatha Muthuswamy, a child psychologist from the National Institute of Mental Health, Bengaluru and presently working at a private hospital in Madurai, told IANS that ""school managements must first concentrate on the mental well-being of children. Several students were brought to me by their parents after showing erratic behaviour and I could find that some of them were facing panic attacks and some were facing depression and others anxiety for no reason at all. So concentrating on the mental health of children is more important rather than stressing them to do well in exams.""Many students, according to counsellors, are panicking about going back to school and many who turn into adults are facing both the physical and emotional changes of their adolescence.Talking to IANS, J. Alageshwari, Student Counsellor at Srinikethan group of schools, said: ""We know that students will take some time to settle down on campus and we have already started off with sensitising teachers to give time for the students to do so and to ensure that they are into the school routine.""Several private schools had mechanisms to reach out to students and parents through online. Schools have been directed to conduct regular counselling for teachers and students who report mental health issues including anxiety and depression.The school management have also arranged professional mental health counsellors to support the students and teachers if they show anxiety, depression, or aggressive behaviour."

Highlights Crash diets can lead to nutritional deficiencies

You should try losing weight in a sustainable manner

Quick weight loss can affect your health in many ways

You might have come across several tips and tricks for weight loss till now. You may also find a number of quick fixes to your weight loss-related issues. Many try crash diets, change their food habits completely or follow some hard to perform workout routine. But is rapid weight loss sustainable? Can it affect your health? ""Weight loss cannot happen overnight. It takes time and if it is very quick and sudden, it can be dangerous and hence, can cause many health problems,"" says nutritionist Lovneet Batra. Let's understand the many side effects of rapid weight loss and why it is important to lose weight in a sustainable manner.

Weight loss: Side effects of rapid weight loss

1. Nutritional deficiencies

Eating a well-balanced diet is crucial to avoid nutritional deficiencies. Several vitamins and minerals are essential for maintaining proper health. Crash diets often make you consume very few calories which make the body miss out on essential nutrients. ""As a result cause hair loss, extreme fatigue, a weakened immune system, and a general decline in health as a whole,"" the nutritionist tells.

2. Loose skin

Batra says, ""Loose skin occurs when the body shrinks in size after the skin has been stretched."" You can avoid this by losing weight slowly and steadily.

3. Liver issues

According to Batra, those who lose weight rapidly are at risk of developing liver issues. This may be due to the sudden changes in your fatty acid profile after your weight loss, or as a residual effect of being overweight.

4. Gallstones

Gallstones are hard deposits that form in the gallbladder. Those who lose weight rapidly are at a higher risk of developing gall stones. ""When on a crash diet, many do not receive enough carbs to burn down the excess bile, obstructing the pancreas. Therefore, you should avoid diets that are low on energy and carbs,"" the nutritionist explains.

5. Muscle loss

When trying to lose fat many often miss building muscles. If you cut down your calorie intake significantly, your muscle mass may suffer. This happens because in such a situation your body breaks down the muscles for energy and fuel.

How much weight should you lose in a week without affecting your health?

Josh Monroe has gone viral for his “point of view” (POV) TikTok videos of young students, sometimes with his therapy dog Nala, on topics like depression, discomfort, and serious issues like ADHD, abuse and more.

‘POV’ is a popular trend that features a situation that unfolds in real-time. The aim is to make the viewer feel that they are present in the room when things are happening.

In his videos, Monroe talks about the importance of understanding mental health issues as well as the personal space that children need.

“I think so many people have connected with the videos I have made because so many of us feel like we were unheard, and that’s all we wanted, was to be heard and feel that connection from an adult. Not be told what to do or how to feel but just be heard, and be seen, and that’s what I try to show in my videos,” Monroe said in a video.

According to NowThis, he hopes that his videos encourage more teachers in being proactive. “My job is to help students with their social, emotional, and academic growth, and part of that is listening to them.

Viren Shetty, ED & Group COO at Narayana Health, said at present their COVID occupancies were barely anything and vaccinations continued as normal. In case of any eventuality, he said the infrastructure has been set up.

""We bought all the ventilators, we set apart all the COVID ICUs and should be in a position to take care of them. Right now, vaccinations continue as normal COVID occupancies are barely anything,"" said Shetty.

He added that COVID is a concern in the sense that it has not been fully eliminated from the country. ""But I would echo what all the other hospital groups are saying that patients are not really coming to the hospital. Those that come, come very early and they do get treated. Now, we know a lot more about how to treat these patients than we did before,"" he said.

The overall COVID numbers, however, still remain stubbornly high. ""We do not know if it would manifest itself in some kind of exponential growth curve and a wave shows up at some point in October, November,"" Shetty said, adding that it was beyond the realm of their ability to plan for but they are prepared.

On Capex plans, he said, since COVID, it has taken a bit of a hold and there is a more modest plan. ""We have around Rs 250 crore planned for this one year, but it will scale up. The fact is that a lot of our hospitals are in need of refurbishment, a lot of equipment to be upgraded, and a lot of capacity to be added in new specialties, specifically oncology,"" he said.

The pandemic has taught that all hospitals are very short of critical care infrastructure and so over the next five years, Narayana group has an aggressive Capex plan on upgrading their existing infrastructure to be able to accommodate all kinds of critical care patients.

“We won't look to add too much new bed capacity, we have sufficient headway within the existing infrastructure and there are about 50-100 beds that can be added, just to account for the differences in the allocation of how we count the beds,” he added.

However, an Indian firm is making sure that nobody ignores their health and in an attempt to encourage its employees and help them maintain a work-life balance, this company has come up with a creative ’12-month get-healthy goal’ programme.

This was shared by the CEO, Nithin Kamath of his company, Zerodha. He wrote about the impact of the pandemic and how their workforce was the “unhealthiest ever” due to various aspects such as lack of physical activity, work-life imbalance and bad diet, among others.

To push the team towards a healthier lifestyle, the company will reward employees who make transformations in their life. He mentioned how to increase the participation, the company along with a 1-month salary will have a lucky draw where the winner will get a reward worth Rs 10 lakhs.

On our internal forum(@discourse), we asked everyone to set a 12-month get-healthy goal & update the progress every month, to create accountability. To increase participation, we said everyone who reaches the goal will get a 1-month salary as bonus & 1 lucky draw for Rs 10lks 2/3 — Nithin Kamath (@Nithin0dha) August 28, 2021

Since being shared online, the post has gone viral on social media. While many praised the company’s initiative, others wondered if it would actually work.

425,Healthcare staff facing Covid burnout? - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/healthcare-staff-facing-covid-burnout-101630259924294.html,Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com,health,"A 27-year-old resident doctor from BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai Central always carries a strip of anti-anxiety pills in her pockets. At night, she breaks into a sweat when images of the over-crowded Covid-19 wards flash in her sleep. In May, she had a mental breakdown and had sought psychiatric help from a private doctor.

“I have been taking care of Covid-19 patients since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020. The first wave was exhausting and frightening as we didn’t know much about the virus. But by the time the second wave hit us, we were already mentally and physically burnt out, and I couldn’t take it anymore,” she said.

Nair Hospital was the first civic-run hospital that was converted into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. Since the start of the pandemic, the hospital has treated over 18,000 Covid-19 patients and hundreds of resident doctors like her, have been the backbone of the hospital.

Although the pandemic curve has flattened and the daily Covid cases have come down to below 400 on an average compared to 10,000 cases recorded in April this year, it has left a long-lasting impact on the mental health of the healthcare workers (HCWs) including doctors, nurses radiographers, lab technicians and anaesthetists, Class 4 employees among others. With an anticipated third wave, they urgently need mental health support, claim doctors.

Increased alcohol use

A 37-year-old Class 4 employee who works at the morgue of King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel turned into an alcoholic to cope with the burnout in the second wave. “He has been in the morgue for the past 10 years but I never saw him so distressed. In April, he was handling 10-15 bodies daily. He would maintain distance from us. Soon, he submerged himself in addiction. Now, he is undergoing counselling at the psychiatry department of the hospital,” said his wife.

During the first and second waves, HCWs had to handle grief, console patients’ families, and other issues added to their mental burnout. Many of these workers had to isolate themselves from their families to avoid the chances of transmission Covid-19. This has caused a severe interruption in family life and relationships.

National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) conducted a survey among 3,083 HCWs across India. They published their findings in April in the Asian Journal of Psychiatry which revealed that 26.6% and 23.8% of the respondents had anxiety and depression respectively.

“In the backward stepwise logistic regression analysis, HCWs with anxiety disorder were more likely to be doctors/nurses/hospital assistants, older, female, unmarried, without a leisure activity, report increased alcohol use and suicidal thoughts after pandemic onset, and having a history of receiving mental health interventions,” reads the study—Mental health issues among health care workers during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Many suffer from anxiety, distress

Even after 18 months since the outbreak of the pandemic, city psychiatrists are getting a lot of HCWs who are suffering from anxiety, distress and depression due to the pandemic.

A psychiatric clinic, Aavishkar Center along with MediaMedic Communication started a mental care helpline number—9172284386 for the HCWs in June. Since, its launch, the helpline has received 632 calls. Almost 90% of the callers complained of anxiety, frustration and fear-related Covid-19 duty in hospitals.

“HCWs are experiencing elevated psychological distress, burnout, and increased risk of mental illness. In April, when cases shot up, there were shortages of beds and oxygen. So, these young resident doctors had to prioritise the treatment of patients. In this, many have lost their critical patients. Now, they feel responsible for their death,” said Dr Nirmala Rao, director of the centre. “They are under too much distress which is also affecting their personal relationships,” she added. Considering the good response at the helpline number, now it is being made available to the public. It will be functional between 9am and 6pm daily.

In many cases, the HCWs who were asymptomatic carriers ended up infecting their family members which further added to their mental health. “My husband and both of my in-laws contracted Covid-19 from me. My father-in-law who was 68-year-old succumbed to the infection. I still feel guilty for it,” said Sunita Rao, 34, a nurse with the government-run JJ Hospital.

No leaves for mental health ailments

Dr Harish Shetty, a well-known psychiatrist said that HCWs aren’t even getting the time for recovery amid the ongoing fluctuation of the pandemic curves. “With rising variants, there may be more pandemic waves like the anticipated third wave. This means that healthcare providers won’t get the required rest for their mental health. While we are focusing on vaccination and more research on the virus, we need to focus on caregivers also,” he said.

Medical colleges have started counselling their HCWs but due to the fear of getting stigmatised, many opt for private counselling. “Mental health still gets stigmatised, hence many of the HCWs avoid getting counselling in their own department and approach doctors outside to maintain their secrecy. Several HCWs from lower working grades don’t even consult psychiatrists or psychologists until it is too late,” said Dr Rao.

Many young resident doctors claimed that there are no leaves for mental health ailments. “Our hospitals talk about the need for mental health but we don’t get any sick leaves for it. We are being denied leaves for recovery from anxiety and depression due to Covid-19 duty for months. No one fights for us,” said a resident doctor from Nair Hospital."
